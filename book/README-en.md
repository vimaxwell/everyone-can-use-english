## Preface

>One day, someone asked on Twitter:

>> @maozhu1: @xiaolai Could you please summarize in 140 characters how to learn English well?

>I replied:

>>Actually, one word is enough: "Use".

The entire meaning of the text in this book can be summed up in two words: "Inspiration".

Some knowledge needs not only to be understood but also to be deeply understood. To deeply understand, one needs not only to learn but also to practice, to repeatedly try and fail, to gain motivation from success, to draw lessons from failure, and to seek up and down for a long journey to achieve results. From driving to starting a business, all kinds of knowledge needed are like this. In the face of such knowledge, we need to understand:

* What - What is it exactly?
* Why - Why is it like that?
* How - What steps must be followed to master it, to apply it?

However, there is another kind of knowledge, often especially important knowledge, that can start to play a significant role the moment you know it, and even, at the moment you know it (What), all its significant roles are fully played out (as for Why and How, they may either be self-evident or vary from person to person, requiring the reader to explore on their own...).

In my personal memory, I have encountered many such "knowledge that can fully play its role as long as it is known" along the way. When I was studying probability and statistics, I encountered the concept of "independent events", which is a typical example of this kind of knowledge. Before that, I naturally thought that if a coin was tossed and landed heads up nine times in a row, then the probability of the coin landing heads up after the tenth toss would be much lower than the probability of it landing tails up... The moment I read about "independent events" in the probability textbook, I realized how ridiculous my previous thoughts were. Because the odds of a coin landing heads or tails are always the same (the appearance of heads or tails on each toss is independent of each other and not influenced by previous results), each accounting for 50%, so even if I toss a hundred times, ten thousand times, or even more times and it's always heads up, the odds of the next toss being heads or tails are still the same, each accounting for 50%.

At this point, all the effects of this knowledge have been fully played out: it can completely change some people - those who accidentally see its actual meaning. No matter who it is, when making almost all decisions, one has to consider "possibility" (academically called "probability"). Many of the decisions I made before I knew the concept of "independent events" would not be chosen in any way after I knew the concept of "independent events" - this is a change, and it is a qualitative change.

Another memorable example is when I was learning programming languages as a child. Over the years, the most influential thing has not been the BASIC I learned at the time, or the PASCAL I learned later, or the C, C++ or whatever I learned later; the most influential thing has been a way of thinking - before running a program, you should repeatedly browse the code and pre-run it in your mind; rather than running it directly after writing the program, and then talking about it if there is an error. This is an important way to save time and improve efficiency. At first, I didn't know how much impact "understanding this way of operation" had on me; but many years later, when I observed that most people around me never had the habit of "pre-running in their minds before doing things", I realized how much benefit knowing that way of doing things brought me when I was young - and it's a benefit that can't be explained to those who don't know. (Perhaps because of this, there are always people who are so helpless: those who can, naturally can, those who can't, no matter what, can't.)
What's more critical is that the acquisition of this kind of knowledge is "irreversible". The moment you know it, it has already changed everything, your life has changed because of it, and it can never be restored. We can no longer ignore this kind of knowledge, turn a deaf ear to it, ignore it, it can take root in an instant, and it cannot be eradicated. For example, people who truly understand the common sense of probability and statistics will absolutely not buy lottery tickets... Because buying lottery tickets is equivalent to disrespecting their own intelligence and the knowledge they have learned in their eyes. But at the same time, lottery tickets are the best-selling products on earth, which shows how many people have never had the opportunity to understand this important knowledge in their lives.

Of course, reading this, readers will agree: perhaps the most worthwhile knowledge to spread (at least worth striving for) is this kind of knowledge. The greatest significance of spreading them, or even the only significance and purpose, is "inspiration". The entire meaning of the text in this book can be summed up in two words: "Inspiration". The author sincerely hopes that after reading these texts, readers will be (at least) inspired in the use of English.

Perhaps some readers will find that there is "too much nonsense" in it, which is simply because of the characteristics of this kind of knowledge: they are too "unimpressive", if they have to appear in their original form, they will not notice them - no matter how important they actually are. Otherwise, they would have been completely changed by this kind of knowledge... But isn't the fact that they are still the same as they were before?

Perhaps some readers naturally follow the inertia of thinking and hope to see more "How". But as explained earlier, in most of this kind of knowledge, the reader, at the moment they understand "What", its role has been fully played out, "Why" may just be redundant explanation, and "How" may either be self-evident or vary from person to person, requiring the reader to explore on their own...

This kind of knowledge is destined to belong to a minority. In addition to the reasons mentioned earlier, there is another important reason: people are only willing to spread the knowledge they believe in - even if that so-called knowledge is fundamentally wrong. What's important is not right or wrong, what's important is feeling. Although "feeling right" and "right" may be tens of thousands of miles apart, but for most people, it's basically the same thing, at least, they would rather it be the same thing. So, what is easy to pass on is those things that "naturally make people believe (feel) are correct", not "things that are actually correct".

A few years ago when I wrote "Make Time Your Friend", I was somewhat pessimistic about its spread, because I knew that most of what was conveyed in those texts was this kind of truth, this kind of knowledge - their nature determined the difficulty of their spread. So, at that time, I felt that as long as there were a few scattered people who could be changed by those texts, it would be a great fortune. The Internet era is full of miracles, those texts are browsed on the Internet with tens of thousands of clicks per month. And after it was printed and published in 2009, it was surprisingly reprinted 11 times within a year, once again beyond my expectation. Even if the ratio of readers who truly accept those truths is very low, due to the huge base, I know that I have indeed changed a lot of people.

It is this kind of motivation that makes me willingly and patiently write down the text in this book. Knowing that they will change some people again no matter what - even though I will never know who exactly they will change in the end. Life is full of helplessness, but some people are lucky like me, after all, they can change something. So, those helplessness, those misfortunes, are somewhat faded.

In fact, this book is also a specific continuation of "Make Time Your Friend". The main theme of "Make Time Your Friend" is very simple: time will not obey our management, we can at most make friends with time; the method of making friends with time is nothing more than "doing the right thing in the right way". And this book, is just to focus the "right thing" on "using English", and then look at what the possible "right way" is.
