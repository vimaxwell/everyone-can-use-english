# Chapter 3: Pronunciation

## 1. Pronunciation is important, but clearly not the most important

On April 17, 2009, David Letterman invited a guest, Joe Wong. Now, if you search "Joe Wong" on YouTube, you can find many videos.

Joe Wong is very thin, wearing glasses, with a stoic face. But as soon as he opens his mouth, the whole audience is already laughing at just one sentence. In the following six minutes, one joke after another (American jokes that lose their flavor when translated into Chinese) had the audience laughing uproariously, with thunderous applause several times. In the end, even his silence became a joke — this is a masterful performance. This overnight sensation, Joe Wong, was born in 1970 in Baishan City, Jilin Province; he studied chemistry at Jilin University for his undergraduate degree, went to the United States for further study in 1994, and received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Rice University in 1999.

Joe Wong, speaking English with a heavy Chinese accent, won over the American audience. This is unthinkable for the vast majority of students in China who are desperately learning English. Since elementary school, whether it's teachers or students, the mainstream view is that "pronunciation must be standard". Countless teachers take pride in and are admired for being able to speak "standard" American or British English. Students and teachers often argue about whether to learn "American English" or "British English", even to the point of blushing and arguing.

Chinese students are often not unable to speak English, nor unwilling to speak English, nor unable to speak English, but basically they dare not speak English. Why not? There are many reasons. One of the most common is the fear of non-standard pronunciation. But isn't it normal for a second language learner to have inaccurate pronunciation? Even in our native language, it took us a long time to be able to speak clearly. When you can express yourself clearly in your native language, how old are you? So why should a person be able to express themselves clearly and accurately in a second language from the beginning? And also have to have "standard pronunciation"?

Why not try it, how many of the following ten Chinese words can you pronounce correctly?

Sign, scandal, jealousy, potential, dealings, comfort, implicated, despicable, can't help but, full of talent

Open your eyes and look at the world around us. In fact, the pronunciation of the vast majority of native speakers is not standard. If you don't believe it, you can first examine yourself, and then see how many people around you can't distinguish between flat and curled tongues? How many people can't distinguish between front and back nasal sounds? Even if you are in Beijing (said to be the heart of the motherland, the "standard pronunciation" of Chinese is said to be based on Beijing dialect), you can still hear all kinds of accents every day. In our country, what proportion of people can speak standard and pleasant Mandarin? Is there 1%? Go to the Broadcasting Institute and see how much time and effort those professional hosts (undoubtedly native speakers) need to spend to train themselves to meet the standards? China is like this, and foreign countries should not be much different in this respect. In English-speaking countries, less than 1% of people can speak a standard and pleasant specific accent.

This is the case for all languages around the world, each language has a variety of accents. English may be the language with the most accents on the planet. In the United States, the accents of Southern California and Northern California are already very different, roughly equivalent to the difference between Shandong and Shanxi people speaking Chinese. The pronunciation of New Yorkers and Detroiters is certainly very different. In London, the difference in accents between the east and south is already very pronounced. Not to mention there are "Scottish accents", "Canadian accents", "Australian accents", "New Zealand accents", "Indian accents"...

Paul Meier (paulmeier.com) is a globally renowned voice training expert. Many actors who have made their way to Hollywood have sought his help to eliminate their "foreign accents" and speak "authentic" American English through his training. His students include (this list only includes a small part of them):

John Ales, Jonathan Brandis, A.J. Buckley, Jewel Kilcher, Jim Caviezel, Simon Baker Denny, Peter Coyote, Stewart Finlay-McLennan, Louise Fletcher, Bill Irwin, Gabrielle Fitzpatrick, Diana Hardcastle, Tom Hulce, Kris Kristofferson, Elizabeth Lackey, Tobey Maguire, Stephen Mailer, Terrence Mann, Callum Keith Rennie, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Kim Myers, Mark Ruffalo, Skeet Ulrich, Celia Weston, David Wenham, Valerie Wildman, Peter Wingfield, Tom Wilkinson, Jeffrey Wright...

On Paul Meier's website, there is a [page](http://www.paulmeier.com/booklets.html) that demonstrates various English dialects with different accents, including:

* Cockney
* Hampshire
* Irish
* Liverpool
* Northern Ireland
* Scottish
* Welsh
* Yorkshire; American Southern (Kentucky/Tennessee)
* Deep South (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi)
* Down East New England
* General New York
* South Boston...

Almost every one of these is not something that students in mainland China who have been accustomed to "a certain pronunciation" for many years can understand. And on [this page](http://alt-usage-english.org/audio_archive.shtml), you can also find voice demonstrations of various dialects. Readers might as well go and listen carefully. Then think carefully, is it necessary to be "standard"? Even if it really is necessary, which "standard" should be used?

Obviously, many people will disagree with the view that "pronunciation is not that important", but this does not prevent the correctness and important significance of this view. In English classes, teachers overemphasize "standard pronunciation", even at the expense of mocking some "typicals", which is actually killing the possibility of student progress, although this is not the intention of those teachers. First of all, the so-called "standard pronunciation" may not exist. Everyone's voice line and timbre are different, how can it be "uniformly standard"? Especially when using a foreign language. Secondly, because English itself is the language with the most "accents" in the world (without one), if the pronunciation is not "standard", you can't speak English, then Irish, Canadians, Indians should not speak English - because they use neither "standard American sound" nor "standard British sound".

I'm not saying that pronunciation is not important, but that it's just one of many factors in good expression. In a sense, those who are not good at pronunciation (not to mention standard) but can express themselves freely are more enviable (such as George Huang), because they have already set off, rather than "forever" hovering at the starting point like most people.

Therefore, as a person who uses English as a second language, there is no need to feel inferior because of your non-standard, unpleasant, unclear pronunciation, which is normal, natural, and inevitable. And language use is essentially for communication. You know, just standard pronunciation does not mean that you can definitely communicate effectively. Effective communication also requires vocabulary, grammar, logic, content and many other factors, and all the factors mentioned later, none of them are more important than "standard pronunciation". Imagine, when the United Nations meets, does every country's spokesperson use "standard British sound"? Or "standard American sound"? Although every country's spokesperson has to speak in English, they all use their own specific accents, but it has never affected effective communication.

As an English user, don't be confused by English teachers. As a teacher, part of the educational product, he will certainly emphasize "correct", "accurate", "standard" - regardless of whether they themselves are really "correct", "accurate", "standard". Sometimes it's sad to think about it. Most teachers have to raise their own requirements, not out of the desire for progress, but just to meet the actually unreasonable expectations of "consumers". English teachers are also human, so most of them have the same psychological limitations or human limitations as most other people. When a person can't do it, he will pretend, and keep pretending until he believes it - then he doesn't need to pretend, because he has reached the realm of "sincerely hypocritical". Those teachers who repeatedly emphasize "standard pronunciation" in class (even if they are really "standard"), have not really thought about the side effects of their doing so - scaring students, they have gained "respect" or "awe", and then these students have a serious psychological barrier to speaking English for a lifetime.

## 2. We are fully capable of significantly improving pronunciation

Let's take another look at the scientific facts. It's hard to know exactly how many languages there are on Earth, but a conservative estimate would suggest there are over 6700 languages, which use about 6000 different phonemes in total. [Patricia K. Kuhl](http://ilabs.washington.edu/kuhl/), a professor in the Department of Speech & Hearing Sciences at the University of Washington, has [researched](http://ilabs.washington.edu/news/Times_Pacific_3_6_05.pdf) that newborn babies actually have the ability to learn any language on Earth. In other words, newborns are "citizens of the world," and their brains can process any of the approximately 6000 phonemes used in those 6700+ languages.

By about six months of age, babies start to pay more attention to their mother tongue. Professor Kuhl explains:

> At this time, these babies are not "losing" their phoneme discrimination ability, but their brains are beginning to develop a filter mechanism that can filter out phonemes unrelated to their mother tongue, or categorize phonemes similar to those in their mother tongue into the same category. As a result, they end up unable to distinguish certain phonemes and the differences between certain phonemes - of course, those phonemes unrelated to their mother tongue. It will be mentioned later that the brain needs such a filter for another reason, which is to categorize the same phoneme emitted by people with different timbres into one category, so that the brain can understand language without making mistakes.

In fact, each language uses a limited number of phonemes. Swedish uses 16 vowels, English uses 8, and Japanese only uses 5; while Chinese uses 6 vowels - one more than Japanese, which can explain why Chinese people find it slightly easier to learn English pronunciation than Japanese people. In our country, some people in certain regions cannot distinguish between "r" and "l". In their (adults') hearing, "row" and "low", "rake" and "lake" are indistinguishable. By about 11 months of age, the filter mechanism in their brains is quite robust, and they transition from being "world citizens" to "citizens of a particular language". By 18 months, babies have started to pay more or less attention to grammatical phenomena and language patterns, for example, they can guess that words ending in "-ing" and "-ed" are likely verbs.

What's more interesting in Professor Kuhl's research is her further investigation into the brain development process of infants growing up in multilingual environments. There are some regions on Earth that are "natural multilingual areas," such as Luxembourg in Europe, and many ethnic minority areas in our country. The children who grow up in these areas are truly affected by that "filter mechanism" in their brains. Since they are exposed to multiple languages from a young age, their "filters" are different from those of single-language users, so they can recognize more phonemes.

Such research results will obviously be used by supporters of the "critical period of language acquisition" as evidence to support their views. Because the fact is there - yet another study shows that second language acquisition becomes increasingly difficult after adulthood. However, the same research results can also prove that "we originally have the ability to acquire any phoneme," "we now also have the ability to acquire any phoneme," it's just that we need to spend time correcting our "filter," or even, we can simply rebuild our "filter" - because the brain is plastic, the brain can even be reorganized. It just takes time.

The biggest fallacy of the "critical period of language acquisition" abusers is that they equate "phonemes" with "language" - they can't tell the difference between two different things. In fact, although the critical period really exists, what it affects is "phonemes," not "language." Phonemes are just one aspect of language. What young people are more likely to acquire is only phonemes, and not all other aspects of language are like this. For example, vocabulary acquisition is obviously faster and faster, young people are stronger than teenagers, and old people (those who live to learn) are stronger than young people; essentially, the more knowledgeable a person is, the easier it is for him to acquire new concepts and new vocabulary. For example, logical ability is an important foundation for the use of text. People who lack logical training can use and come into contact with a much narrower range of language and text. How about being "standard" again with phonemes? Learning a foreign language is not simple, but from another perspective, it is not impossible to learn well. In the final analysis, isn't it just talking and recognizing words? There are countless uncultured people in every corner of the world who can speak fluent, almost perfect mother tongue, but what problems can be solved by phonemes alone? Phoneme learning and language learning are two different things. To take a step back, language itself is meaningless, because it is ultimately just a carrier and medium for recording, transmitting, and communicating thoughts.

In the eyes of scientists, learning a skill is essentially the process of establishing connections between nerve cells in the brain. Michael Merzenich, a retired honorary professor at the University of California, believes that the acquisition of each new skill requires the establishment of billions of new connections between nerve cells in the brain. Such a daunting task will of course take a lot of time. And in this time-consuming and laborious process, there is also a so-called "plateau period" - that is, no matter how much training is done for a period of time, it seems to make no progress. Paul Bach-y-Rita, the pioneer of neuroplasticity research, believes that the "plateau period" is just a phenomenon. During this period, the brain has not stopped developing, and the newly established connections between nerve cells are constantly being consolidated; if practice is interrupted, then the brain will follow the principle of "use it or lose it" to discard those useless connections. So how long does it take for the connections between nerve cells to become "hard to give up"? Paul Bach-y-Rita's explanation is "six months" - this time limit is as hard to cross as human gestation generally requires ten months of pregnancy.

"Refurbishing" or even "rebuilding" one's phonetic filter is absolutely possible. But why can't most people do it? Professor [Paul Bach-y-Rita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bach-y-Rita) gives us a relatively clear clue: most people can hardly persist for more than six months. What's more regrettable are those who have persisted for five months. They are clearly about to cross the plateau period, but because they give up a little bit in advance, they "waste all their previous efforts" - the synapses of brain neurons don't know how to cherish, they only have one principle: "discard if not used". If you want to rebuild, sorry, it still takes at least six months - and this time will get longer and longer as you age.

: Because Luxembourg is adjacent to France and Germany, people there are proficient in three languages from an early age: Luxembourgish, French, and German. When they reach middle school, they start learning English. The fourth language they learn - equivalent to our "second foreign language".

: For example, my hometown, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province. There, many people can use Chinese and Korean - two completely different language systems - with equal proficiency. In fact, China is vast, and many places are multilingual areas. From a phonetic point of view, Shanghainese, Cantonese, Wu language, etc., are all different languages.

## 3. The Biggest Obstacle: Fear of Being Ridiculed

Another important worry for not daring to speak English is being ridiculed by people around. This is indeed annoying. But think about it: would a normal person ridicule a baby's staggering steps? No. Would a normal person ridicule a disabled person? No, and they shouldn't. So look again, does it make sense for someone to be ridiculed for speaking a foreign language with non-standard or unpleasant pronunciation? Does it make sense for someone to be ridiculed for speaking a foreign language with an accent for a lifetime and not being able to change it?

Everyone must have people around them who like to ridicule others. But ridiculing others is stupid. If just because one person is better or does better in some aspect than another person can ridicule the other person, then this person will eventually be ridiculed by others, who can be better than others in every aspect? Ridiculing others is always destructive to others, and it can't be constructive to oneself, because ridiculing others itself will not improve one's own level, at most it will get some illusion of happiness.

Babies learn to listen before they learn to speak. The fundamental reason for this is that "speaking" is much harder than "listening" - "listening" may only need to "distinguish", but "speaking" needs to use another organ to make a sound on the basis of "distinguishing" clearly, and often needs to correct and adjust. Therefore, in daily life, as long as a person has a little bit of foundation, they can distinguish whether others' foreign language pronunciation is good or not, no matter what their own pronunciation is like. Interestingly, most of the ridicule comes from this feeling of "being lenient with oneself and strict with others", which is essentially worthless, even if the person who makes the ridicule gets nothing but a false illusion.

Truly civilized people do not mock others. Civilized individuals may resort to coarse or vulgar language when angry, but they never casually insult or ridicule others, as they have long learned constructive criticism and understand the importance of respecting others as well as themselves. Only uncivilized individuals resort to mocking others. Those who casually ridicule others are disgraceful, even more uncivilized than those who spit indiscriminately.

People who excel at something rarely mock others because they know firsthand how difficult it is to do something well. A student once asked the cello maestro [Pablo Casals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Casals) why he still practiced for long hours every day, to which the maestro replied, "Because I am improving every day!" It's hard to imagine such a master having the inclination or desire to mock others. In his later years, Mr. Mei Lanfang never criticized his students when teaching them opera. Whenever they made a mistake, Mr. Mei Lanfang would always say, "Just practice more, it's hard to get good..."

So, really, don't mind the mockery from others. If you make a mistake, just correct it. If you can't correct it, as long as you're not hurting others, it's fine - you can't hurt anyone with just a bit of an accent in your English. If your English pronunciation is a bit off, or your accent is a bit heavy, it's not your fault, and you've never, and are unlikely to ever, hurt anyone because of it. Those who mock you should be mocked by you, but because you are civilized, you can't stoop to their level. As for the mockery from others, if you actually care about it, then you've really let them succeed, because you're hurt, and they're gloating. If you don't care at all, they lose their energy, because they can't get pleasure from it - the fragile ones can only get angry, or get angry at themselves.

## 4. Listen, Listen, and Listen Some More

Reshaping your phonetics should start with "renovating" or "rebuilding" your phonetic filter. We must relearn the ability to recognize the phonetics used in the target language (for example, English). Because we find it hard to articulate phonetics that we can't distinguish. Enrolling in various spoken language training courses often provides little practical help beyond psychological comfort. The most effective method is actually cost-free - significantly increasing auditory input.

During the process of acquiring our mother tongue, our hearing is almost constantly stimulated by the phonetics of our mother tongue, but the process of learning a foreign language is pitifully lacking in comparison. From my observation, most college students, despite claiming to have studied English for over ten years, actually have no more than two hours of English auditory input per day, and have never sustained this for many days. To achieve the best results, a large amount of input must be ensured, and as mentioned earlier, this must be sustained for at least six months.

What many people may not have thought of is that "whether you understand" is not important here. The purpose of significantly increasing auditory input is to rebuild phonetic recognition ability, and the focus is not on text comprehension ability. At 18 months, babies have already built a good phonetic filter for their mother tongue, but they can't fully understand the content they hear every day. Professor Kuhl's research results inspire us, in fact, English preschool education can be free: parents don't speak English, it doesn't matter, as long as they continuously play various English phonetics (nursery rhymes, novels, TV dramas, etc.) in the child's activity environment, and persist for a long time. As long as this is done, children don't need to go to any training classes. By the time they start elementary school, the child's "bilingual phonetic filter" should have solidified. In fact, I suspect that various English preschool educations occupy too much time that could be used to acquire other skills, thereby limiting the development of the child's brain. However, you can't expect to just listen to recordings and watch TV, and children can learn foreign languages - just said, phonetic learning and language learning are two different things. Language learning also requires a lot of other stimuli and efforts. The same is true for adults, significantly increasing auditory input is to quickly rebuild their own phonetic filter. After this, if you want to make progress, "understanding" is very important. Because only when you understand can you concentrate, and concentration is the fundamental prerequisite for all learning.

Another thing that many people may not realize is that "progressive learning" may not necessarily be a good strategy, at least not when it comes to "rebuilding the sound filter." You should start listening to materials at a normal speed from the beginning. Voice of America (VOA) has a famous program called Special English, which is a resource for many Chinese people to learn English at the "beginner" or "intermediate" level. There was a time when countless people risked being accused of "eavesdropping on enemy stations" to listen to this program, just to learn English well. I believe the original intention of this program's design was good. It believes that people should learn English in a "progressive" manner, and that English at a normal speed and with normal wording is too difficult for beginners. Therefore, it only uses about 1500 "basic vocabulary", only uses the most basic grammatical structures, and deliberately slows down the broadcast. But I doubt its real effect. My observation is that many people once they start listening to VOA SE, they can't put it down after a while - because the feeling of "being able to fully understand" is really good; after a while, they turn their heads to listen to CNN or other normal-speed materials, and they immediately feel strenuous, and then they "feel" that their "foundation is not good enough", so they return to VOA SE, and many years have passed, and they are still listening to VOA SE. The most important reason is the same as the previous point: at this time, whether you understand it or not is not important; what is really important is to let the part of your brain responsible for hearing continue to receive enough English sound stimulation for a long time.

Another seemingly unreasonable suggestion is "don't just listen to standard recordings." The reason why many people's learning is half the effort is because their practice is contrary to the "natural language acquisition method." The reason why a baby's brain needs to develop a "mother tongue sound filter" is not only because it is easier to understand the mother tongue, but also because the brain needs to process many variants of the same sound - because the baby listens to many different people using the same sound every day, and each person's timbre, tone, and intonation may have his own unique characteristics. Therefore, the brain must have such a filter that can classify the different variants of the same sound input into one category - only in this way can it process the sound input without errors. Therefore, when you greatly increase your English auditory input, you should explore different timbres, different tones, different intonations, and even different accents. In this sense, radio dramas are much stronger than textbook recordings, because there are many people talking, not just one "standard" voice from beginning to end. Furthermore, I often advise my students not to limit their input materials to "standard American pronunciation" or "standard British pronunciation"; it doesn't matter, even the distinctive "black English" can be listened to, even the more mixed the better. What I often recommend is [CNN's broadcast](http://www.cnn.com/audio/radio/radio.html), which contains various accents of English, which can really open up the "ear" world.

Over twenty years ago, English learning equipment was quite primitive. A whole class would use a single desktop cassette player, flipping the same tape back and forth for an entire semester. Now, students can purchase MP3 players at a very affordable price that can hold countless materials. Even the mobile phones that they carry around can play MP3s, which is incredibly convenient. For nearly a decade, I have been listening to audiobooks every day. I've switched devices many times, starting from a 32M player produced by Creative in Singapore, then moving on to an HP PDA, an HTC smartphone, and now an iPhone. Here's a little tip: when listening to English audio, don't put headphones in both ears—just use one ear. Natural voice input and headphone input are different. In a natural environment, the language sounds we hear are never "isolated"—they are always accompanied by various background noises. When wearing headphones, however, there is basically only "pure voice", which is not beneficial for us to rebuild our own voice filter. Another advantage of using only one earphone is that you can often switch ears to listen, so as not to damage your ears.

As mentioned before, you should persist for at least six months. I personally suggest that the daily input time should not be less than four hours—once you start, you will find that it is not difficult because "it doesn't matter if you don't understand". The more you listen, the longer you listen, sooner or later there will be a day when it is not easy to not understand. Of course, even at the very beginning, for better results, you can consciously gradually increase the difficulty of the text, and it is best to combine intensive reading. During this period, almost everyone will feel that there is no progress, but this "feeling" is unreliable—in fact, our feelings are almost always extremely unreliable. Look at the two lines below, which one is longer?

![](images/figure06.png)

Of course, it feels like the second line below is longer, but in fact, these two lines are the same length. Some people even feel that the two squares above are smaller than the two squares below, but that is also an illusion; some people feel that the line below is thicker than the line above, but that is still an illusion. Whenever you feel discouraged because you feel that you have made no progress, you might as well think about this picture, remind yourself that "feelings are not reliable", and then recall Professor Paul Bach-y-Rita's explanation of the "plateau period". Then quickly restore a calm and peaceful state, and continue to work.

## 5. Computer-Assisted Tools

In addition, if you are familiar with computer operations (in fact, you must be familiar), you can also find some audio editing software as auxiliary tools, such as Cool Edit, Audio Edit Deluxe, Audacity, etc. These software are equivalent to "audio visualization" for users, and you can clearly see the gaps between voices and the strength of the volume through the audio spectrum. Moreover, it is easy to use them to repeatedly play a certain section of audio (accurately defining the start and end points) countless times.

### Brief Instructions for Using AudioEdit

As shown in the figure:
1. Open the sound file (mp3, wav)
2. Loop play button
3. Use the left mouse button to define the start point, and the right mouse button to define the end point, to select a section of the audio
4. Place the mouse pointer in the selected area and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the audio graph

Although people who learn English as adults (or start learning English seriously after becoming adults) can't achieve perfect pronunciation no matter what, as long as the method is right and they put their heart and soul into it, there is always a lot of room for improvement. I am a living proof of this. When I was young, my English pronunciation was said to be good, but that was what my junior high school teacher said, and now I think it's not reliable. Later, like most students in China, I didn't speak a single English word for several years. Many years after graduation, by chance, I started teaching at New Oriental, and my spoken English was a mess. At first, I taught reading, then writing, and in the meantime, I taught various courses. Although the classes were taught well enough, my pronunciation was often ridiculed.

If there is any quality that makes me secretly happy, it is that I am not easily affected by others' ridicule. This may be related to the fact that I don't care too much about my shortcomings and am good at comforting myself. If I'm ugly, I'm ugly. After all, men don't rely on looks (in fact, I can't rely on them even if I want to); if I'm not tall, I'm not tall. After all, being too tall wastes fabric for clothes (in fact, I also know that taller people are more likely to gain trust - this is not what I said, it's the result of psychological research); if my pronunciation is bad, it's bad. After all, I'm not the worst (at that time, I was still at New Oriental, who was the worst can't be said, otherwise he might be fired, haha; now I have left New Oriental, it still can't be said, otherwise people will think I'm not kind) - anyway, I'm better than most Japanese, right?

However, I still struggled to reshape my pronunciation, using the recordings of the TOEFL listening test as materials. The concentrated training time was really not very long, about three months, and it improved a lot once. Then it was a long time listening to various audiobooks, and in a blink of an eye, many years have passed, and no one ridicules my pronunciation anymore. Maybe they are tired of ridiculing, or maybe my pronunciation has basically passed - I think the latter possibility should be greater. Because speaking is something that gets better as you speak.

## 6. Be Lenient with Yourself

"Being strict with oneself" is a good habit. However, when trying to reshape your own pronunciation, you can "be lenient with yourself". In practice, I even tell students that the first principle is (at least) temporarily not to pursue "standard" too much - in fact, pursuit is useless, because no matter who it is, it is impossible to reach the so-called "standard" in a short period of time.

The habits of oral movements vary greatly among people who use different languages. A newborn baby can't speak because they don't yet know how to use their lips, tongue, throat, vocal cords, and other organs. They also don't know how to control the flow of air to produce different sounds. They need to listen, observe, distinguish, imitate, and correct over and over again before they can start babbling. It takes several years, or even longer, for a child to speak clearly - of course, a considerable number of people may never be able to speak clearly in their lifetime (like the well-known Mr. Jay Chou).

Once the organs involved in vocalization begin to adapt to a language, they will gradually become more accustomed to certain movements, while at the same time, it becomes increasingly difficult to make some movements that are not commonly used or not used at all when speaking their mother tongue. When speaking a foreign language, if some oral movements are difficult to make, the organs will involuntarily combine to make a relatively closest movement, so the final sound that comes out sounds like another sound. For example, most Koreans have difficulty pronouncing the sound "v" - because this sound does not exist in their language, so after they have studied the explanations in the phonetics course, the sound they make "by following the example" is always "b". This is the same reason why many people in the south cannot pronounce the consonants "f", "n", or cannot distinguish between front nasal sounds and back nasal sounds. They might say "skin" as "pi hu", "woman" as "donkey", or "women's basketball" as "girl"...

I have a Korean friend who always says "video" as "bideo". At first, I was not used to it and unconsciously corrected him once or twice, but I found that he seemed to not know that he said "video" as "bideo", and more like he always thought he was saying "video". One day I teased him by saying "video" as "bideo", and he immediately jumped up (without realizing that I was joking) and said, "Ha, your pronunciation is wrong, that word should be pronounced 'bideo'!" - Then I realized that there was such a fun thing: people who pronounce incorrectly can't hear that their pronunciation is wrong, but they can instantly judge when others say the same mistake. So I thought "I might have such moments too" - and later found out that it was indeed the case, but the sounds I pronounced incorrectly and didn't know were wrong were just some other sounds.

Although many phonetics courses are well-intentioned, they explain the process of each pronunciation in too much detail, too complicated, and too difficult to learn. In fact, it's okay to just get a rough idea first. This is not to say that the principles of pronunciation should not be learned, on the contrary, they should be learned and learned well; however, the fact is that even if you don't learn for a while, it's not completely impossible - as long as you listen and speak more, you will gradually get closer to the standard. But most people misunderstand what "a lot" in "listen a lot and speak a lot" actually means. And the so-called "a lot" is definitely not one or two hours, not one or two days, not one or two months, but at least one or two years of uninterrupted daily practice. Some people claim to have studied for many years, but in fact, the time they actually used to practice during those years was so intermittent and long that it was equivalent to zero. So it actually requires more and more intensive practice. Children acquire those common oral movement patterns from scratch, and it takes many years to slowly become proficient (i.e., speak clearly); while adults often need to use more effort to struggle with the habits they have formed, shouldn't they need more time?

When people are learning the pronunciation of a foreign language, they often unconsciously set their short-term goals too high, which inevitably leads to unimaginable frustration, simply because they have set a goal that they cannot reach. Teachers often demand too much from students - they start criticizing students' pronunciation as not standard and are eager to correct it too early. In fact, students also demand too much from themselves, it is impossible to require themselves to be standard when they just start learning. After practicing for a while, they should study the pronunciation principles in the phonetics course more carefully, try to understand various rules, and then use these knowledge to correct themselves through repeated practice. But what's more important is to speak and practice more. As long as you listen, speak, and practice enough, anyone can do well enough.

## 7. Slow down your speaking speed

Looking back, I found that I, like many others, made many elementary mistakes. For example, I once thought that "speaking fast" was "fluent". With a little observation and a little thought, one should know that "fast" and "fluent" are not the same thing at all.

In fact, while many Chinese students are complaining that normal speed English is "too fast and incomprehensible", they speak English faster than foreigners - this is not an easy phenomenon to observe clearly, nor is it an easy phenomenon to explain clearly. People often confuse cause and effect. When listening to a foreign language, it is not "because people speak too fast so I can't understand", but "because I can't understand so I feel that people speak too fast".

For example, there is a word you don't know in a sentence you hear, such as "idiosyncratic"; what you hear at the time is a string of syllables combined together that you don't know what it means, so your brain will involuntarily think (even guess) what it is - this requires time and energy (even in milliseconds). And when we are not proficient, our brains find it difficult to handle more than one task at the same time, and while you are thinking hard, the speaker goes on talking, so you may "miss" some information - of course you think people "speak too fast".

Understanding this cause-and-effect relationship is actually very important. Because this is one of the important reasons why many people can't speak English well. Precisely because they got this cause-and-effect relationship wrong, many people, especially when they want to speak "good" English (such as during exams, during interviews), will unconsciously speed up, not only fast, but excessively fast, and in the end they may speak so fast that foreigners can't understand.

Even without this factor, Chinese people will unconsciously speak English faster. The reason is that every Chinese character is composed of a consonant and a vowel, and Chinese vowels do not distinguish between long and short. English is different, vowels not only distinguish between long and short, but also between single and double, and there is a "short" vowel that is slightly longer than other short vowels and slightly shorter than long vowels: /æ/ (readers might as well listen to the pronunciation of the word "ab" in Webster's Dictionary and the pronunciation of the word "ebb", and distinguish between /æ/ and /e/). So, when Chinese students say apple, what they actually say is epple (fortunately there is no such word, so it won't be confused by the listener); most Chinese students read important as /ɪmpɔtənt/, not /ɪmpɔːtənt/, even though they all know that the word "beach" means something else if it is read short; for example, /aɪ/ this diphthong, Chinese students basically read it as the Chinese word "love".

Because each long vowel is pronounced as a short one, Chinese students often speak English "half a beat" faster than native speakers in certain places. When they finish a sentence, they unconsciously speak several beats faster than native speakers. Therefore, when you start practicing shadowing, you need to compete with yourself. On the one hand, you need to overcome your desire to speak "faster". On the other hand, you need to deliberately prevent yourself from speeding up unconsciously - the vowels should be long where they should be, and the diphthongs should be as full as possible.

## 8. Pauses are More Important than Linking

Perhaps because people always want to speak a foreign language a little faster, they unconsciously pay more attention to "linking" when studying the characteristics of natural language flow. In fact, linking may be the least important of all the features of natural language flow. The reason is simple: once you are proficient, you naturally link up, and if you are not proficient and insist on linking up, it will be particularly stiff.

Another difference between English and Chinese is that the basic unit of Chinese is "character", which is composed of one initial and one final, that is, each character has only one syllable; the basic unit of English is "word", which may be one syllable or multiple syllables. The "word" in Chinese corresponds to the "phrase" in English. The longest English word is said to be composed of 189,819 characters, which is the chemical name of the currently known largest protein "titin". Who knows how many syllables that word has, and I wonder if I will meet anyone who can pronounce that word in this life? The longest vocabulary in the English dictionary is composed of 45 characters—pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis—the electronic version of Webster's Dictionary (ver 3.0) does not have its live pronunciation audio file. If you want to hear how this word is pronounced, you can only listen to the pronunciation of Microsoft's speech engine - there is one in the "Concise English-Chinese Dictionary" in Kingsoft PowerWord.

Because there are many words in English that are composed of multiple syllables (the word "pneu" just now has a total of 18 syllables!), English syllables are divided into stressed and unstressed. In order to pronounce a syllable that falls on the stress as a stress, there is a particularly important detail to pay attention to, that is, there should be a pause before the stressed syllable - it may be very short, or it can be exaggerated. The existence of this pause will make it possible to clearly pronounce the stress afterwards.

For example, the word "especially", we might as well exaggerate when practicing. Start from the position of the stressed syllable and divide this word into two parts: "e"|"specially". After pronouncing "e", close your mouth (prepare to pronounce the syllable "spe") and wait for a full second, then forcefully pronounce the "spe" that you just prepared and the "cially" that follows. Do you feel that the syllable "spe" is clearer? You can practice with a few more words, such as: un|fortunately, im|portant, under|stand, edu|cation, par|ticular, fi|nancial...

In our native language, each word is read at a consistent pace, without any pauses - for example, "highs and lows," or "wailing in grief." Therefore, we are not accustomed to the idea that there could be pauses within an English word. But in fact, in the minds of native English speakers, a word can indeed be broken down. There are many examples to illustrate this point, such as in Hollywood movies, where people often say "absolutely" as "ab-fucking-solutely" or "abso-fucking-lutely."

Interestingly, the pronunciation of words in the dictionary (real human voice recordings), even though it's a single word pronunciation, often does not have a noticeable pause before the stressed syllable (perhaps precisely because it's just one word). This might be why most beginners rarely notice the existence of this pause.

If there can be pauses within a word, it goes without saying that there can be pauses within a sentence. But once the mechanism is understood, and through repeated practice and continuous improvement, we will find the pauses between the flow of speech becoming clearer and clearer. It's important to know that no matter what language a person speaks, they will instinctively vary their voice according to the meaning of the sentence. If you can't distinguish the pauses, you can't grasp the rhythm, and if you can't grasp the rhythm, everything becomes difficult. So, the first habit to develop is to pause where you should pause. When following along with a recording, beginners often feel that the speed of the recording is fast, and they may not even realize that people also take breaths when reading long sentences - how can you speak without breathing! In the end, when we can truly understand what someone is saying, even if they speak very fast, we can hear clearly; even if some parts are not clear enough, we can guess. (Do you remember the "module" mentioned earlier?)

## 9. Many times, it's not just "inaccurate," but simply wrong!

When we are mocked for our poor pronunciation, the mocker doesn't have the patience to tell us exactly where we went wrong, how we went wrong, and how to correct it - of course, first of all, they might not know, and they probably never thought about it seriously. It's almost certain that we rarely see a native English speaker mocking us, the second language learners, for our poor pronunciation. In fact, as long as our pronunciation is not too bad, native speakers often exclaim, "Wow, your English is really good!" Especially those foreigners who have stayed in China for a while, because they know how hard it is to learn a foreign language - of course, what they might not know is that the Chinese they are learning is the hardest foreign language to learn on earth, without "one of." I rarely (I guess others do too) see people who do well mocking others who do not. Because those who truly excel know how hard it is to get there. Mr. Mei Lanfang was amazingly patient when teaching his students; when a student made a mistake, Mr. Mei would just say, "It's hard to do well..." Perhaps that's the reason.

In fact, many times (and it should be more often), our so-called "poor pronunciation" is not that our English phonemes are inaccurate or non-standard, but we simply mispronounce the entire word. I have a particularly deep impression of the word "façade". When I first saw it, it was not written as "façade" in print, but as "facade". There is no "ç" (c with a tail) in English; so I naturally read it as /ˈfækeɪd/—I even thought I was very standard! Like most students, I once pronounced "specific" as /ˈspesɪfɪk/ instead of /spɘˈsɪfɪk/. Generally speaking, most college students in China may mispronounce at least three of the following five words: "cellist", "facade", "heir", "niche", "specific". I mispronounced all of them at first.

So, 1) you must make up for phonetic symbols; 2) you must read phonetic symbols when looking up words, and make corresponding marks on your own text; 3) do not take it for granted to read words. The last point is especially important. For example, many people first learn the word "penalty", and then learn "penalize". As a result, those who are not serious will carelessly pronounce "penalize" as /ˈpenəˌlaɪz/ instead of /ˈpɪnəˌlaɪz /. For example, the three words "economy", "economics", and "economist", the first syllable of "economics" is read /e/, while the first syllable of the other two is /ɪ/, many people will get it wrong, let alone which one is the stressed syllable of each word in these three words.

To avoid the embarrassment caused by taking it for granted and being self-righteous, it is best to look up the dictionary every time you learn a word. This is an era of rich and advanced learning tools. People in the past (even just ten years ago) could not imagine the convenience of learning now. Almost every dictionary has an electronic version, and even a few hundred yuan electronic dictionary also has a real person pronunciation system. Every time you learn a word, you have to spend a little more time and energy to read all the derived words of this word—of course, it is based on phonetic symbols, or the real person pronunciation in the dictionary.

Don't mind the trouble at this point, because mistakes are accumulated bit by bit. Once the mistakes accumulate to a certain extent, the horror is unimaginable. Students often ask me, "Teacher, do I still need to memorize the pronunciation when I memorize words?" When I encounter such a question, I am very upset, because I know that I can't persuade them with one or two sentences; in fact, when they ask me this question, what they probably want is not my answer, but my recognition.

I have walked this road myself, and I really know the hardships. When I started to correct my pronunciation, I had finished the GRE, and my vocabulary was very large—but this means that the volume of mispronounced words is also very large. I have a notebook, full of dozens of pages of words, all of which have been mispronounced (I have never dared to count how many there are). And the largest proportion of them is the kind of stress position error. This kind of mistake is very annoying, because they are not very obvious usually, even if someone hears it, they may be too lazy to help you correct it, because one or two stressed syllables mispronounced words will not completely distort the sentence meaning. So, even today, I often "find" a mispronounced stress again, which is very painful. I am really lucky: I happened to find a job teaching English at that time, so I have time, motivation and practice opportunities. Otherwise, I guess I won't have the chance to improve in my life, because the mistakes have accumulated into a disaster, and I must be looking at the sea and sighing, powerless.

## 10. Mastering Phonetic Transcription is a Must

Phonetic transcription is crucial, everyone knows that. But many people find learning phonetic transcription particularly challenging. They even lose the confidence to continue studying English in depth because of it. Their thinking has some basis. After all, what is phonetic transcription? Isn't it equivalent to Chinese Pinyin when you get down to it? Why is learning Pinyin so difficult? Do I really lack talent?

However, when we first learned Pinyin, the situation we faced was indeed different from when we later learned phonetic transcription. Many people were taught Pinyin in kindergarten, but at that time, whether they could learn it or not was not so important. The kindergarten teacher knew that her goal was not necessarily to teach, but to teach anyway. Later, in the lower grades of elementary school, Pinyin had to be learned again. If you think about it carefully, even "just learning it again" is not enough. In fact, what really played a decisive role was the three to five years afterwards, where we were constantly using Pinyin to look up dictionaries (remember carrying the "Xinhua Dictionary" in your school bag when you were a kid? - of course, later this dictionary was replaced by the larger and thicker "Modern Chinese Dictionary") - it was this long-term use that made us proficient in Chinese Pinyin as if it were instinctive. That is to say, most of us have learned it at least twice systematically, and then continuously applied it for several years, before we have mastered this thing that we look back on today and find incredibly simple.

Chinese is our mother tongue, and we have had several years of language use experience before we started school - we didn't wait until we started school to speak. In fact, most people started to recognize characters in kindergarten (some even earlier). That is to say, when we were learning Pinyin, we could already speak, understand a considerable amount of language, and our literacy volume had already exceeded a certain amount. Once we mastered Pinyin, our literacy speed would greatly increase, and in the end, most people had mastered three thousand common Chinese characters (at least the vast majority of them) in the first three years of elementary school. In other words, when we are learning English, we first learn phonetic transcription too quickly, and we also learn it too early. Even phonetic transcription has to become the starting course of phonetics teaching - but when we learned our mother tongue, we started (had the ability) to learn Pinyin only after we had basically acquired the ability to pronounce perfectly!

So, in a sense, learning phonetic transcription is indeed a difficult hurdle. But once the mechanism is clear, you can come up with the right way to "easily master" phonetic transcription. First, don't rush for success; second, master phonetic transcription through a large amount of repeated use; third, use a large amount of reading training to unconsciously overcome the initial hurdle of phonetic development. I personally believe that only when a person's pronunciation reaches a normal level (or close to normal) can they be considered to have the basic ability to easily master phonetic transcription. And once the basics of phonetic transcription are mastered, they should be applied at all times, until they understand English phonetic transcription as well as they understand Chinese Pinyin.

Chinese students also have another worry when learning phonetic transcription. Most of our textbooks use D.J. phonetic transcription (British pronunciation), but this is not the only phonetic transcription system. In addition to D.J., some places use K.K. phonetic transcription (American pronunciation) in their textbooks; Oxford Dictionary and Cambridge Dictionary both claim to use IPA international phonetic transcription, but they are more or less different; and some students, when preparing for SAT or GRE, start using Merriam-Webster Dictionary based on the advice of their seniors, only to find that it uses a completely different system of phonetic transcription - in fact, almost all dictionaries on the market are using different systems of phonetic transcription. Something that was already not easy to learn has so many versions - of course, it is even more discouraging.

Fortunately, today's students already have the opportunity to use better learning tools - dictionaries have become electronic dictionaries. Most electronic dictionaries or dictionary software on computers are equipped with real human pronunciation. So, when you look up a word, even if you don't recognize the phonetic notation, you can hear the pronunciation of that word. However, it is best to be able to write phonetic notation by hand, because after looking up the dictionary, it is best to make a mark on the text so that it will be easier to remember in the future. At this point, the goal of learning phonetic notation has changed somewhat - for most people, these marks are not written for others to see, they are written for themselves to see, so as long as they can recognize them, it's fine. (Although it would be better to be able to do everything properly.)

In fact, I discovered a long time ago that when I annotate text with phonetic notation, I use a "unique" "hybrid system". For example, I don't know when, I started using /ɛ/ instead of /e/; and since I slowly leaned towards American pronunciation, I would often add a voicing symbol /t̬/ under /t/; even after leaning towards American pronunciation, I still don't like to use /ɚ/, but use /ər/; even when I first learned K.K phonetic notation, I didn't like to write /a/ by hand, but wrote /ɑ/... Even so, I have never felt that this "messy" system has any impact on my further learning, not only can it be used, but it works quite well.

Here is a summary of the phonetic learning strategy

* First, make sure you have enough reading experience. For example, read for an hour every morning (just listen to the recording and read the textbook) and stick to it for at least three months. In this process, most of the languages have been mastered well enough (it will take a long time to get close to "standard"), so learning phonetic notation is guaranteed.
* Only learn one system completely. If you are still in junior high school, you can choose D.J. phonetic notation, or K.K phonetic notation - that is, the one used in your textbook. If you have been learning English for many years, then you should choose the phonetic notation system of the dictionary you are currently using and most often use.
* It is best to use the sound version of the dictionary on the computer, so you can look up all the example words and record them into mp3. Repeat and read along.
* Compare the phonetic notation table, copy the phonetic notation of each example word, and repeat it several times (preferably more than 7 times).
* Copy down the list of example words, then write the corresponding phonetic notation from memory, and then check (at least twice).
* Every time you look up a word in the future, you should mark the phonetic notation on the original text.
* It is necessary to spend time learning English spelling rules. Ignoring spelling rules is a mistake made by the vast majority of people who fail to learn English. They would rather learn the seemingly more short-term, or feel more "advanced" "root suffixes", and not learn the most basic, and can be used for a lifetime of spelling rules.

In fact, many people just don't bother to copy phonetic notation. Although they will keep encountering the embarrassment of "Hey, I have looked up this word, but how do you read it?" - But obviously, these embarrassments are not enough to make them determined to be meticulous from now on - so, the cost of "meticulous" accumulates more and more, and in the end it is high to the point where most people are unwilling to bear.

In fact, with a slight modification in the method, it's not that troublesome. For instance, after looking up the word "façade", you don't necessarily have to transcribe the phonetic notation in its entirety as [fə'sɑːd]. In reality, you just need to mark /s/ on the letter "ç", mark /ɑː/ on the second letter "a", and then add a stress symbol before /s/. After all, the letter "f" can only be pronounced as /f/, the letter "d" can only be pronounced as /d/, and the last letter "e" is silent, which is the rule for the majority of English words. Similarly, after looking up "resumé", the most important thing might be to mark /'ei/ with a stress symbol on the last letter "e". And those words that fully comply with the spelling rules (in fact, more than 96% of English words basically comply with the spelling rules) basically do not need to annotate phonetic notation, such as the word "ichthyosaur". The pronunciation of "ch" is /k/, the pronunciation of "yo" is /ɪə/, the pronunciation of "aur" is /ɔː/, and the stress is on the first syllable - in fact, it seems that you only need to mark the syllable where the stress is. Of course, some people think that it should be marked /k/ at the "ch", but in any case, there is no need to write down such a long string: ['ɪkθɪəsɔː]. In a few cases, when a certain letter in a word is silent - for example, the "b" in the word "debt" - then I would directly draw a line on that letter with a pencil to remind myself that the letter is silent.

Usually, no matter what, I will mark the stress on the syllable of the word I am reading, and then mark the pronunciation of those vowel combinations that originally have multiple possible pronunciations in the current word, and in a few cases, some special consonants need to be marked, because most consonants are pronounced the same as the letters.

Today, good English learning resources are almost everywhere in the world, and I often recommend the following two resources to students:

* To learn British pronunciation and its phonetic notation, you can use the Flash tutorial "Guide to English Phonetic Symbols" from the Hong Kong Chinese site of Oxford University Press.
* To learn American pronunciation and its phonetic notation, you can use the American phonetic online learning program "Phonetics: The Sound of American English" from the University of Iowa.

## 11. Syllable Division

The syllable division of most words, based on word spelling and based on phonetic notation spelling, is similar, such as "pri•ma•ry "/ˈprai-mə-ri/, such as "ich•thyo•saur"/ˈɪk-θɪə-sɔː/. But there are also many words whose syllable division, based on word spelling and based on phonetic notation spelling, is very different, such as "tax•i"/ˈtek-si/, such as "cur•dling "/ˈkər-də-liŋ/.

In our textbooks, the division of syllables is based on word spelling, not phonetic spelling. The main purpose of dividing syllables is to correctly mark the pronunciation of words so that learners can pronounce them correctly. If this is the case, then the division of syllables based on word spelling is not as meaningful as the division based on phonetic spelling. And if the division of syllables has other purposes, it may be used to help remember the spelling of words. However, the division of syllables based on phonetic spelling can also be used to help remember the spelling of words, and no matter which method of syllable division is used, the same spelling rules must be learned in order to use it as a mnemonic. (As for what other purposes the division of syllables has, I really don't know.)

In addition, if students only learn (if they really learn) the division based on word spelling, they are likely to easily fall into the trap of taking it for granted. For example, the word "create" is actually two syllables /kriː-ˈeɪt/, many beginners (also because they have just learned a little spelling rules) accidentally regard this word as a monosyllabic word; I have seen many students read this word as / kriːt /, probably for this reason.

So, as English learners, what may be more useful to us is the method of dividing syllables based on phonetic spelling.

The division of syllables based on word spelling is very troublesome and verbose. I don't remember which teacher explained the "transition rule" to me clearly, but I saw it in some book, and after reading it several times, I felt that it was particularly useless for English learners, or even useless at all. The division of syllables based on phonetic spelling is very simple, only one most important principle is needed: a syllable must have, and only have one vowel.

The common syllable structures are as follows (the following words are all monosyllabic words):

* Vowel: a /eɪ/, eye /aɪ/
* Consonant + Vowel: tea /tiː/, bay /beɪ/
* Consonant + Consonant + Vowel: fly /flaɪ/, sky /skaɪ/
* Vowel + Consonant: ebb /eb/, odd /ɔd/
* Consonant + Vowel + Consonant: beep /biːp/, big /bɪg/
* Vowel + Consonant + Consonant: east /iːst/，axe /æks/
* Consonant + Consonant + Vowel + Consonant: stop /stɔp/, bleed /bliːd/
* Consonant + Vowel + Consonant + Consonant: last /læst/, lapse /læps/
* Consonant + Consonant + Vowel + Consonant + Consonant: blast /blæst/, frost /frɔːst/

And for polysyllabic words, just use the above patterns to see how many syllables that conform to the above patterns can be divided - the auxiliary principle is very simple: for polysyllabic words, except for the last syllable, the above 9 kinds are mostly the first 5 kinds.

## 12. The Phenomenon of Stress and Unstress in Natural Language Flow

As previously mentioned, many English words are polysyllabic. If an English word is composed of multiple syllables, at least one of them will be stressed; if there are enough syllables, there might also be a secondary stress (as in "archaeopteryx"), and more than one primary stress (as in "postmodernity"). Similarly, in a sentence with multiple words, at least one word will be stressed, while the others will be relatively unstressed. (For convenience, the stress within a word's syllables is referred to as "unstressed", "secondary stress", "primary stress", or "stressed"; the stress within a sentence's words is referred to as "stressed" and "unstressed".)

Mastering the rules of stress and unstress is key to making your language flow natural. As long as you master the rules of stress and unstress, even if some phonemes are not pronounced well, the language flow will still appear natural and be more easily understood by others. In American thriller movies, we often hear foreign agents, such as Russian or Iranian agents, speaking English. Despite their obvious accents, they not only speak fluently but also communicate without barriers - and the other party, who speaks "authentic standard" American English, does not fail to understand them because of their accents. This situation can illustrate that while the pronunciation of individual phonemes is important, there are obviously more important things to pay attention to, such as the rules of stress and unstress that are currently being discussed.

> * The examples used below, the audio files are located in the `files/TOELFL-PartC-93/audios/` directory...
> * [Right-click this link to 'Save as...' the audio file used in this section to a local folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaolai/everyone-can-use-english/master/files/TOELFL-PartC-93/audios/1.mp3)

Below are the first two sentences from the first article in the TOEFL listening recording. Please note the specific differences between the first and second occurrences of the word "community":

Community service is an important component of education here at our university. We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. ...

Please pay close attention to the two instances of "community" in the above recording. The first instance of "Community" is stressed, so the second syllable /mju:/ is pronounced very fully, with tone and a higher pitch. The second instance of "community" is not stressed, so the second syllable /mju:/ becomes very short and has no obvious tone.

In this audio recording, all the words that are stressed are marked in the following text (those not marked are read weakly):

**Community** **service** is an **important** **component** of **education** **here** at our **university**. We **encourage** **all** **students** to **volunteer** for at **least** **one** community **activity** **before** they **graduate**.

When a word is stressed or read weakly, the length of the vowel and the location of the stress (if it is a multi-syllable word) will change accordingly. The common changes are as follows:

If a word is stressed, then in this word:

* Long vowels will be read very clearly, and long enough, even longer;
* Diphthongs will be read very full, and seem very elastic;
* Short vowels that fall on the stress will appear longer;
* The syllable where the stress is located may have different tones (flat, rising, falling)...
* The syllable where the stress is located may have different pitches (often "high", "medium", "low" among the "high")...

If a word is read weakly, then in this word:

* Long vowels will become shorter (almost equivalent to the length of short vowels);
* The stressed syllable will become as light as the non-stressed syllable;
* Many vowels will change, leaning towards /ə/;
* The vowel /ə/ after the light consonants /s/, /t/, /k/, /f/ may be directly omitted;
* The pitch of the whole word is often "low" among "high", "medium", "low", at most "medium"...

In fact, even when reading a single word, the length of the vowels will be affected by the stress. For example, the word "city", the stress is on the first syllable, and the vowels in both places are the same: /ˈsi-ti/; but as long as you read the first syllable heavy enough, you can naturally feel that the first /i/ is longer than the second /i/.

Most auxiliary verbs, linking verbs, prepositions, conjunctions, articles, pronouns, all have two pronunciation forms: strong reading style, weak reading style. These words are often single-syllable words. In natural language flow, they are more often read out in a weak reading style. The following is the most common and popular strong reading style, weak reading style comparison list. Note that the following list cannot be used as a rule, not all function words must be read weakly in any situation; nor must all content words be read strongly. The following list is just describing the phenomenon.

* will: /wil/→/əl, l/
* would: /wud/→/wəd, əd, d/
* you: /juː/→/ju/

These words in their weak form are especially common in TOEFL listening. For example, the word "our" is often pronounced as /ar/. This can be seen in the following two sentences:

I hope you've all finished reading the assigned chapter on insurance -- so that you're prepared for our discussion today. (Sentence 1 of Article 2)

One of our main jobs is to keep detailed records of the migration patterns of raptors. (Sentence 3 of Article 90)

## 13. Fine-tuning /t/, /d/, and /s/

During the learning process, the easier the content, the more likely it is to be overlooked by students, which can lead to many artificial difficulties. The pronunciation of /t/, /d/, and /s/ in English is such a point of knowledge.

The /t/ in English is different from the [t] in Chinese pinyin, although they sound very similar. The same goes for /d/ and /s/. However, because the [t], [d], and [s] in Chinese are quite close to the /t/, /d/, and /s/ in English, Chinese students basically replace /t/, /d/, and /s/ with [t], [d], and [s]. At the beginning, it's hard to see what's so big about this "replacement", and it doesn't seem to have a fatal impact. However, once bad habits are formed, they will be hard to correct and become the glass ceiling for many people's progress.

You might want to try saying the following simple Chinese sentence:

    I kick——you to death……
    I hit——you to death……

Say it a couple more times. Please deliberately elongate the word "kick" a bit, so it's easier to feel where the tip of the tongue starts when pronouncing [t] in Chinese —— the tip of the tongue first touches the teeth, then leaves, while the airflow in the mouth vibrates. In addition, you can also feel the starting position of the tip of the tongue for [d] (when saying "hit") and [s] (when saying "die") in Chinese pronunciation. In the IPA international phonetic notation, there are special notations for [t] and [d] (dental t/d) in Chinese where the tip of the tongue touches the teeth as the starting point of pronunciation: /t̪/, /d̪/ (please note the small "door" shape symbol under t/d).
【Note】The oral side profile pictures used in this series of articles are taken from the University of Iowa's illustrated online tutorial, [Phonetics: The sounds of American English](http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonetics/english/frameset.html):

As shown in the figure above, the starting position of the tongue tip for the /t/ sound in English is not on the teeth, but on the upper gums - a little bit above the junction of the teeth and gums. Therefore, the /t/ sound in English and the [t] sound in Chinese have different timbres - the [t] in Chinese has more obstruction to the airflow. Similarly, the starting position of the tongue tip for the /d/ sound in English is also at the same position, as shown in the figure below:

![](images/figure09.png)

Furthermore, the starting position of the tongue tip for the /s/ sound in English is not against the upper teeth. The starting position of the tongue tip is roughly the same as for /t/ and /d/, but it does not touch the upper gums, leaving a slight gap (as shown in the figure below). Again, due to the different starting positions of the tongue tip, the /s/ sound in English and the [s] sound in Chinese are quite different.

![](images/figure10.png)

Practicing these consonants is not difficult, readers only need to repeatedly practice one word, which is "student". After practicing this word many times, practice "students" - as you can imagine, the starting position of the /ts/ sound in English should be the same as the starting position of the /t/ sound, and /dz/ should be the same as /d/.

> We encourage all **students** to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. A new community program called "One On One" helps elementary **students** who've fallen behind. (Sentence 2~3 of the first paragraph)

There are two instances of "students" here, so feel free to imitate and experience them repeatedly. If you are already familiar with this starting position of the tongue tip, then when you read words like "**teacher**" and "**particular**" in the future, you will feel that their timbre is very different from before the correction.

Due to the different starting positions of the tongue tip, compared to the /t/, /d/, and /s/ sounds in English, the [t], [d], and [s] sounds in Chinese obstruct more airflow when pronounced; [t] and [d] almost completely obstruct the airflow, and although [s] must have airflow passing through the tongue tip to make a sound, it also obstructs more airflow than when the tongue tip is pronounced /s/. Many of us, when speaking with foreigners, always feel that they "send more air" when they speak, and there is a feeling of more airflow vibration, which is the reason.

There is also a fun reverse practice method. That is to replace all the [t], [d], and [s] in the two Chinese short sentences "我踢死你" and "我打死你" with the /t/, /d/, and /s/ explained above, practice repeatedly, and finally, if these two short sentences sound like a foreigner speaking Chinese, then it's correct.

Additionally, there is a very clear instance of connected speech in this sentence, "helps_elementary...". Please repeatedly experience and practice it. Recall the content discussed in the "Pause" section - when practicing this connected speech, the key is to first pronounce the syllable /hel/, then close your mouth (which is equivalent to having already made the mouth shape for the /p/ sound), pause for a sufficient length of time, and then pronounce the /s/ sound while starting to read the next word. Also, the stressed syllable of the word "elementary" should be emphasized (that is, the first syllable), and this stressed syllable also carries a rising tone. After understanding these key points, we will find that the so-called "connected speech" is just a natural thing.

Regarding /t/ and /d/, there will be more in-depth explanations in the following content.

## 14. Conquering the So-Called Connected Speech, Starting with the Consonant /l/

Let's talk about the consonant /l/. This sound is not much different from the [l] in Chinese. However, in English, many vowels are followed by the /l/ syllable, while in Chinese, only [l] as an initial is followed by a rhyme (that is, equivalent to the vowel in English). It is likely that because there is no situation in Chinese where a rhyme is followed by the initial [l], many Chinese students actually have difficulty with /l/ at the end of the syllable. (And some southern students can't distinguish between /l/ and /n/, which is a problem they have when using their mother tongue, unrelated to English.)

Most students have no problem reading words with /l/ at the beginning of the syllable, such as law, value, fly, etc. When pronouncing the /l/ in these words, it is almost the same as when saying [l] in the Chinese sentence "Have you eaten?", of course, it's not difficult. However, when they read a word with /l/ at the end of the syllable, it's incorrect. For example, "lawful", "valuable", "financial", "still", etc. Most students will read these words as /ˈlɔːfəu/, /ˈvæljəbəu/, /faɪˈnænʃəu/, and /ˈstɪəu/, respectively, and the end of each word will be read as the pronunciation of the letter "o".

The important reason for this mistake is that the accurate pronunciation of the /l/ sound is completed by the continuous movement of the tongue in the oral cavity. Since all important actions are completed in the oral cavity, and the way the tongue moves cannot be observed from the outside, many people learn this sound, which is basically similar to the effect of "blind men touching an elephant".

![](images/figure11.png)

When reading these words, the end of the word is basically /əl/, not /əu/. When pronouncing /əu/, there is almost no action of the tongue in the oral cavity. However, when pronouncing /əl/, the tongue does have movement. From the beginning of the /ə/ sound, the tip of the tongue is moving towards the direction of the gums, until it touches the gums, the pronunciation is considered to be over. This incomplete or even missing tongue position movement causes most students to read /əl/ as /əu/.

Repeatedly read aloud the words we just mentioned, and experience the pronunciation changes brought about by the tip of the tongue sliding until it touches the gum: "lawful", "valuable", "financial", "still".

Then, please try to read this sentence aloud by yourself, read it several times, until you get familiar with it:

> I'm sure you'll enjoy this community service, and you'll gain valuable experience at the same time.

Now listen carefully to the recording of this text: the fourth sentence from the end of the first article. Beginners will immediately find that there is a clear difference between their reading and the recording: in the recording, the /l/ sound at the end of two words is connected with the vowel at the beginning of the adjacent word:

> I'm sure you'**ll_en**joy this community service, and you'll gain valuab**le_e**xperience at the same time.

First, let's see how to read "valuable experience" like in the recording. If, when the /əl/ at the end of the word valuable ends, the tip of the tongue is not on the gum, then in order to read the "connected reading" effect in the recording, you need to restart the movement of the tip of the tongue, so it sounds very clumsy. Therefore, when reading /əl/, it is very important for the movement of the tongue tip to be complete. Furthermore, using the knowledge about "pauses" mentioned earlier, in order to clearly read the syllable /ˈpɪ/ where the stress is, add a bit of exaggerated pause beforehand. Read it like this: /ˌvæ-ljə-bə-liks-...-ˈpɪ-rɪəns/, close your lips immediately after pronouncing /liks/, wait a while, then slightly forcefully pronounce /ˈpɪ/, and it feels right. Try it a few more times and you will definitely master it. In fact, "you'll enjoy" in the above sentence works the same way.

If you still feel very stiff, then there is one more place that needs to be improved. The reason why the connected reading is still awkward and stiff after improving the position of the tongue tip at the end of the /l/ pronunciation is usually because the stress of the next word is not clearly stressed. You might as well exaggerate the stress of the second word's stressed syllable when practicing:

> You'll_en**joy**, valuable_ex**pe**rience

If the word ending with /l/ is followed by a word, the first syllable is stressed, then the entire /l+ vowel/ will be stressed, such as "real audio", which will be read as /ri-ˈlɔ:-diəʊ/

Listen carefully to the following sentence:

> Professor Dodge will act as a mentor to the tutors... (Paragraph 1, Sentence 9)

If there's anything to note about "connected speech", it's that in two connected words, the stressed syllable of the second word must be clearly pronounced (in fact, if the following word is not stressed, it naturally won't produce a connected speech effect, or even if it does, it's not so obvious). And in order to pronounce the stressed syllable clearly, there might need to be a slight pause before the stressed syllable.

See? So-called connected speech is not deliberately connected, but if the oral movement of the previous consonant is complete, then you will naturally get the "connected" effect. Even the so-called "sound change" to be explained later is the same mechanism, not deliberately, but naturally. Connected speech is not as important as many teachers claim and many students think, and the solution cannot be to "connect" for the sake of "connecting", which is just treating the symptoms and not the root cause.

And other consonants, compared to /l/, are much easier for Chinese students, and there's no need to practice specifically (and the most important /t/, /d/ and /s/ have been talked about before). The more you follow along, the more you read aloud, and the more you speak in the future, the better everything will naturally be.

## 15. Master Voicing, Starting with /t/

/t/ is really a consonant worth spending time and energy on, even after this section is over, it will be brought up again.

After knowing that the starting position of the tongue tip of /t/ is different from that of Chinese [t], you also need to know another important feature of the consonant /t/: when /t/ is sandwiched between two vowels, /t/ will be voiced. The most obvious example is the word city, where /t/ is surrounded by vowels, so when pronounced, it is no longer /t/ but /t̬/ (please note the small "v" shaped symbol under t ). Another example is the word meet, pronounced /miːt/, but when ing is added, it becomes /ˈmiːt̬ɪŋ/—/t/ becomes /t̪/, which sounds very close to a /d/ sound. /t/ is called a "voiceless consonant" precisely because of this, while /d/ is called a "voiced consonant" because it vibrates the vocal cords when pronounced.

And in natural speech flow, the situation where /t/ is surrounded by vowels is even more common, because many words end with /t/, and there are also many words that start with a vowel. Please listen carefully to the following recording:

> You education majors might be especially interested in it because it offers the opportunity to do some teaching -- that is, tutoring in math and English. (Paragraph 1, Sentence 4)

In this case, the phrase "it offers" undergoes a phenomenon known as linking, where the /t/ is sandwiched between two vowels. The same principle applies to the /t/ in "that is". The voiced /t̬/ is very similar to /d/, as they share the same tongue-tip starting position and, unlike /t/, it's not just airflow vibration but also a slight vocal cord vibration. However, /t̪/ is relatively more abrupt and feels more elastic. In fact, it's perfectly acceptable to pronounce /t̪/ as /d/, as the difference is minimal.

Strictly speaking, it should be like this: when the unvoiced consonant /t/ is sandwiched between two vowels, the former being a stressed vowel and the latter being an unstressed vowel, /t/ will be voiced to /t̬/. For instance, "writer" and "rider", "latter" and "ladder", "petal" and "pedal" all sound quite similar. Therefore, the "second t" in the previous word "opportunity", and the "second t" in "tutoring", are not voiced.

But honestly, this is indeed hard to distinguish, especially for Chinese students who are learning English as a foreign language. So, first understand the phenomenon of "voicing", then try to imitate it, but there's no need to be overly demanding. In fact, after speaking a lot, even if you don't deliberately "voice", it will naturally be as it should be. Moreover, this is just a small detail in pronunciation, and its role in achieving good communication only accounts for a very small proportion.

Furthermore, in natural speech flow, the unvoiced consonants /t/, /k/, /p/, /ʧ/ that fall in the stressed syllables and are located after /s/ are often voiced. So, "study" sounds like /sdʌdɪ/, "school" sounds like /sgu:l/, "experience" sounds like /ɪksˈbɪərəns/, "strive" sounds like /sʤaɪv/.

However, sometimes these unvoiced consonants are not voiced even though they are preceded by /s/, because these consonants and the following vowels do not form stressed syllables. So, the consonants after /s/ in words like "distance", "costume", "biscuit" are not voiced. Of course, the /t/ in the word "coast" will definitely not be voiced.

## 16. Mastering Unreleased Plosives, Starting with /t/

/t/, oh /t/, I might as well kick you to death.

Please listen carefully to the following recording:

> I hope you’ve all finishe***~~d~~*** reading the assigne***~~d~~*** chapter on insurance — so tha***~~t~~*** you’re prepare***~~d~~*** for our discussion today. (Sentence 1 of Article 2)

In this, the "ed" at the end of the word "finished" should be pronounced as /t/ because it follows the voiceless consonant /sh/. However, because the next word starts with a consonant ("reading"), the /t/ becomes an unreleased plosive, so it can't be heard. There are three more instances where /t/ or /d/ become unreleased plosives and can't be heard.

What needs to be emphasized is that the so-called "unreleased plosive" is not an omission. In fact, the movement of the speaker's tongue inside the mouth is complete. When /t/ or /d/ ends, the tip of the tongue still has to touch the position of the gums (as shown in the figure below), but there is no airflow vibration, so it can't be heard.

![](images/figure08.png)

The most critical point is that these /t/ and /d/ that can't be heard due to being unreleased plosives still occupy their original length in the speech flow. Therefore, "might be" is not pronounced /maibi:/ but /mai(-)bi:/, where (-) is the position where the tip of the tongue is fixed on the gums, pauses slightly, and then emits the sound /bi:/. Don't forget the pause, it feels like muting the strings when playing the guitar. Listen carefully to the recording below, pay attention to "might be" and "interested in it".

>You education majors **migh*~~t~~* be** especially **interested in *~~it~~*** because it offers the opportunity to do some teaching — that is, tutoring in math and English. (Sentence 4 of Article 1)

The consonants that may become unreleased plosives also include /p/, /b/, /k/, /g/. For example, the /p/ in "helps" below, and the /k/ in "looks":

> A new community program called “One On One” hel***~~p~~*s** elementary students who’ve fallen behind. (Sentence 3 of Article 1)

> It looks good on your resume, too... (from the first paragraph of the second block)

Standard phonetics textbooks will further explain "loss of plosive" and "incomplete plosive". Personally, I believe that for most people, there is no need to delve deeper. Language learning is like this: first grasp the basics, and then through a lot of practice and application, you can naturally learn many things that you don't even know how you learned.

A side example is that in Chinese, at a certain level, the word "编" and the word "织" mean the same thing - even "编织" is the same meaning; however, we will say "this girl knits sweaters", "that boy writes stories", but we will definitely not say "they are knitting stories." The last sentence is obviously wrong. As for why it is wrong, and how we avoid this mistake - we don't know, and we don't need to know, anyway, we just won't make such mistakes. Oh, actually, we should have known it a long time ago. We have a clear explanation in Chapter 2 "2.7 Reading Training Can Improve Language Text Pattern Recognition Ability".

## 17. Conquer the so-called "assimilation"

/t + j/ may become /ʧ/. For example, "want you..." in the following example:

> Then tonight I want you to go home and read a passage into a tape recorder and evaluate your own voice. (from the last sentence of the 16th paragraph)

But it's not always the case. Sometimes, the speaker treats the /j/ after /t/ as a consonant. In this case, the previous /t/ "loses its explosion". By definition, /j/ is a "semi-consonant" or "semi-vowel". I guess it's like this. When the syllable where /j/ is located is a stressed syllable, /j/ is treated as a "semi-consonant"; and when the syllable where /j/ is located is a non-stressed syllable, /j/ is treated as a "semi-vowel". For example, in the following sentence that has been heard before (heard before), the /t/ in that, although followed by /j/, but /t/ is lost, not combined with /j/ to produce assimilation.

> I hope you've all finished reading the assigned chapter on insurance -- so that you're prepared for our discussion today. (from the first sentence of the second paragraph)

/d + j/ is the same. Many times, /d/ combined with /j/ will become /ʤ/. But at other times, it does not produce sound changes. For example, the following sentence:

> **What should you do, then**, on those sleepless nights? (Paragraph 20, Sentence 10)

In this sentence, the /t/ at the end of "what" combines with the /ʃ/ at the beginning of "should" to become /ʧ/, while the /d/ at the end of "should" combines with the following /ju:/ to become /djə/ (because "you" is weakly pronounced, and the following "do" is strongly pronounced). In this sentence, the /d + j/ combination does not cause a phonetic change to become "ʤ".

/s + j/ may become /ʃ/. Note that it is "possible" rather than "mandatory". In fact, there are not many situations with /s + j/, the most common is the phrase "this year". Whether a phonetic change occurs really varies from person to person - some people have their tongue surface higher when pronouncing /s/, while others do not have their tongue surface so high. For people with a higher tongue surface (the first sentence below), it feels like it has become /ðɪ-ˈʃɪə/, while for those without such a high tongue surface (the second sentence below), there is no noticeable change. (In fact, even the same person may not always speak the same way, for example, they may sometimes have their tongue surface a little higher, and other times not so high.)

> As the committee in charge of **this year's** tree-planting project, we have several items on our agenda. (Paragraph 9, Sentence 2)

> When you entered as first-year students **this year**, the school assigned you to a dorm and a roommate... (Paragraph 40, Sentence 2)

The key to naturally producing these sounds caused by "assimilation" is that the tongue tip starting positions of /t/, /d/, and /s/ must be correct. If you compare the tongue tip starting positions of /t/ and /ʧ/, you will know that the tongue tip starting positions of these two sounds are roughly the same. But if you pronounce /t/ as the Chinese [t], then the tongue tip starting position is on the teeth rather than the gums, so no matter what, you can't naturally produce "assimilation".

Ah, why is it /t/ and /d/ again? - This is actually not strange, knowledge distribution is always like this, a large amount of focus is often only concentrated on a few or even one part. For example, in English grammar books, almost 2/3 of the content is about verbs - the same principle applies.

## 18. Summarize /t/

/t/ is the one among all English phonemes that students need the most time and energy to learn, and teachers should explain it patiently.

* The starting position of the tongue tip for the English /t/ is different from the Chinese [t], with the English /t/ starting on the gums;
* If /t/ is sandwiched between two vowels (and the preceding vowel is in a stressed syllable), it should be slightly voiced;
* When /t/ is followed by a consonant, it often results in what is known as a plosive loss phenomenon; the same is true for /d/;
* If the following consonant is /s/, then it should evolve into the sound /ts/; while /d/ evolves into the sound /dz/;
* /d/ will be read as /t/ after /p/ and /sh/;
* /t + j/ may become /ʧ/; while /d + j/ may become /ʤ/ (this is what is known as the assimilation phenomenon).

## 19. Emphasizing Technique: "Tone"

You should have heard the following passage many times:

> Community service is an important **component** of education here at our university. We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. A new community **program** called “One On One” helps elementary students who’ve fallen behind.（第1篇第1~3句）

Please carefully ponder the pronunciation of the emphasized words "component" and "program" in the above text. Listen several times, try several times.

These two words are stressed in the sentence, so each syllable is quite clear, and the tone of the stressed syllable is also very clear.

First, recall the "tones" in Chinese: neutral tone, first tone, second tone, third tone, and fourth tone. Then try

* For the word "component", it reads like this: com (neutral tone), po (fourth tone), nent (second tone);
* And for the word "program", it reads like this: pro (fourth tone), gram (first tone); also, make the vowel /æ/ a little longer than the short vowel. Note: Although /æ/ does not have a long vowel symbol ":" behind it, it is a "semi-long vowel", longer than a short vowel, but shorter than a long vowel.

——Because "neutral tone", "first tone", "second tone", "fourth tone" are all tones we are familiar with when speaking Mandarin Chinese, so it will definitely be easy to handle.

In English phonetics teaching books, "tone" has never been mentioned, all are about "intonation" —— perhaps the designers of teaching content think that learning a "foreign" language should use a "new" way; or maybe I am ignorant and have not seen enough. However, this is inevitable: we must rely on our understanding of known things to understand unknown things, because analogical thinking is almost the only means to bridge the gap between known and unknown. And if we can find known information that can be used to explore the unknown, but do not use it, it is quite unreasonable and uneconomical.

> Analogical thinking is almost the only means to bridge the gap between the known and the unknown. When a primary school teacher says, "The structure of the earth is actually similar to a boiled egg," they are using analogy to help students leap from the known (a boiled egg) to the unknown (the structure of the earth). When a middle school teacher says, "The structure inside an atom is actually similar to the structure of the solar system," students understand instantly for the same reason. Therefore, I often encourage students to read miscellaneous books whenever they have time—the more miscellaneous, the better, and the more, the merrier. Why? Because reading miscellaneous books can greatly enhance a person's ability to accept new things (a kind of understanding ability). People with rich experiences and extensive reading definitely have stronger understanding abilities because they are more likely to quickly find information that can be used for analogy in their existing knowledge when they encounter the unknown.

In natural language flow, words that are stressed often carry tones other than light tones—there are "first tone," "second tone," and "fourth tone." Right, "third tone" is rare. If a word in English makes us feel that there is a "third tone," it is not emitted by a single syllable, but is spliced by two syllables—the first syllable is "fourth tone," and the second syllable is "second tone." Just like the "component" we practiced earlier. And some combinations, like the "program" just now, do not correspond in Chinese tones. And for weakly pronounced words, each syllable is basically equivalent to a "light tone."

How important it is to master the tone can be clearly explained with a Chinese example. When foreigners speak Chinese, we, as (Chinese) native speakers, can immediately hear that it is a foreigner speaking Chinese (even if it is just on the phone and we can't see the other person). Many times, this is not because the foreigner's pronunciation of a certain initial or a certain rhyme is inaccurate when speaking Chinese, but because the tone is inaccurate.

We might as well try it ourselves. The four characters of "foreign language in a row," the pinyin is "yáng huà lián piān" (level, oblique, level, level), now try reading these four characters as "yāng huà liǎn piàn" (level, oblique, oblique, oblique). Every initial and every rhyme is correct, but the tone is wrong. Even if we are native speakers (so, the initials and rhymes are impossible to read wrong), what we say is also a strong "foreign accent."

On the contrary, even if we speak English with every consonant and every vowel read very "standard," but if the tone is not correct (or it is not the pattern that people are familiar with), then it will definitely sound with a very heavy "foreign accent."

In Huang Xi's English, the most obvious "Chinese accent" basically all comes from the discordance of the tone (however, please note that Huang Xi's "foreign accent" has no effect on the audience's understanding of him—besides pronunciation, there are many other more important factors that determine the success or failure of communication):

For example, the word "wife," he read it as "second tone," and if he reads the diphthong /aɪ/ as "fourth tone," it might not be so awkward. (Note, this is not to say that all /aɪ/ must be read as "fourth tone" and cannot be read as "second tone.")

In my teaching, I've found that students only need to remember the following three patterns to greatly improve the quality of their natural language flow:

* Long vowels are mostly "first tone" (it's impossible to pronounce as "third tone");
* Diphthongs are mostly "fourth tone" or "second tone" (it's hard to pronounce as "first tone");
* Short vowels can hardly be "first tone" (because if pronounced as "first tone", it becomes a long vowel).

These are just basic patterns, not guiding principles. So, when following along, you can only rely on careful pondering, diligent recording (recording is also simple, just mark "1", "2", "4", "0" on the vowel, where "0" represents "light tone"), and then practice repeatedly. It's actually quite easy to adapt to, I can explain this in about ten minutes, and many of my students can become thoroughly proficient in just an afternoon, and then they feel like they've undergone a "complete transformation"...

After sorting out this matter, I even feel that there is no need to deliberately spend time teaching students about "intonation". They don't need to study it specifically and can quickly grasp "rising intonation" and "falling intonation" (concepts in the intonation part of English phonetics courses).

## 20. Vowels /ʌ/ and /æ/

The pronunciation of /ʌ/, in American pronunciation, is very close to /ə/. It's even hard to distinguish between the two. For example, the word "encourage", in dictionaries commonly seen in China, is marked as /inˈkʌriʤ /, but in TOEFL listening, the /ʌ/ in this word is very close to /ə/. In fact, Webster's Dictionary simply marks it as: /in-kər-ij/. The following sentence (of course) has been heard before - I used to hear people say that it's enough to practice a tape well; but in fact, my personal experience is that it's enough to practice a few sentences well...

This time you can pay more attention to the word "encourage":

> We **encourage** all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. A new community program called “One On One” helps elementary students who’ve fallen behind.

You might as well continue to try to practice the pronunciation of the following words:

* abduct
* above
* brunt
* brush
* budget
* bump
* bunk
* bus
* but
* chuck
* club
* come
* cover
* crush
* cut
* deluxe
* discuss
* dump
* exult
* glutton
* hull
* hunt
* hush
* hut
* love
* lunch
* mumble
* nothing
* ruffle
* rummage
* rush
* slumber
* slush
* some
* son
* struggle
* stubborn
* stucco
* study
* stump
* such
* supper
* trouble
* under
* until
* up
* upper
* us
* usher
* wonder

Additional tips: 1) You can pronounce /ʌ/ in the same way as /ə/, only that /ʌ/ should be relatively shorter; 2) When pronouncing /ʌ/, the degree to which the lips are opened should be much less than for /ɑ/.

The pronunciation of /æ/ is quite special. Apart from English, few other languages use this vowel. Moreover, in American English (as in the TOEFL listening test), many /ɑ/ sounds are pronounced as /æ/, such as "after", "ask", "glass", "master", "pass", etc.

Note: Although the /æ/ sound does not have a long sound symbol /ː/ following it when marked with phonetic symbols, its length is close to the length of long vowels.

Please pay close attention to "ask" and "after" below:

> My recommendation is that we **ask** the administration to keep the center open **after** midnight for studying. (The third last sentence in the 86th article)

You might as well continue to practice the pronunciation of the following words:

* absolute
* add
* admiral
* after
* alcove
* ambulance
* ample
* annual
* answer
* ant
* anthem
* apple
* ask
* baggage
* bank
* bashful
* basket
* bass
* bat
* bath
* castle
* cat
* command
* dance
* disaster
* fabric
* frank
* glass
* grass

## 21. Diphthongs

Diphthongs are essentially composed of two short vowels, connected by the glide of the tongue. Generally speaking, the first vowel is a bit longer than the second. Moreover, the composition of the diphthong usually determines that the syllable containing the diphthong is where the stress lies.

In diphthongs, /aɪ/, /eɪ/, /ɛɚ/, /ɪə/, /ɔɪ/ have no lip movement when pronounced, all the action is in the glide of the tongue.

Take /aɪ/ as an example. Readers can practice like this:

* Open your mouth (you can exaggerate a bit, open your mouth a bit wider), pronounce the sound /a/ three times, each time a bit longer, with a rising tone, and pause slightly between each time;
* After pronouncing /a/ three times, the fourth time, without any movement of the lips (that is, still keeping them open), only by the glide of the tongue, pronounce /aɪ/, and make it a falling tone. It feels like /a/ is a bit longer, then it slides down to /ɪ/ in a falling tone.

Please repeatedly follow the recording【This recording is excerpted from DAVID ALAN STERN's phonetics course, "[The Sound and Style of American English](http://dii.nju.edu.cn/summer/sas/index.htm)"】, and carefully appreciate it.

/eɪ/, /ɛɚ/, /ɪə/, /ɔɪ/——these diphthongs, when pronounced, their principle is exactly the same as /aɪ/, the key point is that when they are pronounced, there is no movement of the lips.

But for /aʊ/, /əʊ/, /ʊə/, because /ʊ/ exists in the composition of the vowels, the lips will have to move (lip shape from large to small: /aʊ/, /əʊ/; from small to large: /ʊə/).

In addition to these points to note mentioned above, in the TOEFL listening reading recording, as long as a word is stressed, the diphthong in it will definitely be pronounced very full, full of elasticity, and it is also the place where the tone changes ("second tone", "fourth tone", unlikely to have "first tone"); and long vowels such as /a:/, /i:/, /ə:/, /u:/, /ɔ:/ (, and the so-called "short" vowel /æ/, often only have one tone ("first tone"), and often appear to be shorter than diphthongs.

Please pay attention to the diphthongs in the recording, and their tones of these diphthongs, of course, also appreciate the rhythm and beat composed of the length of the vowels (italicized are long vowels):

> Community service is an important component of education here at our university. (Sentence 1 of the first article)

## 22. Other Consonants /θ/, /ð/, /v/, /ʒ/

The consonants /θ/ and /ð/ are often emphasized by many English teachers in China - but the emphasis is not always correct.

It's still about the starting position of the tip of the tongue. These two sounds are not at all like many teachers say, that you must start pronouncing by clamping the tip of the tongue. In fact, when reading the consonants /θ/ and /ð/, the starting position of the tip of the tongue should be the inside of the upper teeth (of course, if you have to clamp it, no one will force you not to clamp). Please refer to the following two diagrams:

![](images/figure12.png)

![](images/figure13.png)

For Chinese students, /v/ is actually not difficult to pronounce, it's just not used to it, just pay more attention to it usually. Many students just overcorrect, when reading /v/, they retract the lower lip too much, so that the entire upper teeth are exposed, of course, it is hard to speak. In fact, the tip of the upper teeth only needs to touch the inside of the lower lip, as long as it feels a bit more airflow blockage than /w/.

![](images/figure14.png)

/ʒ/ has been complicated by many teachers. In fact, this sound is very close to the [zh] in Chinese pinyin, but the most important difference is that when reading [zh] in Chinese, the starting position of the front tongue surface is attached to the upper dental arch, while when reading /ʒ/ in English, there is a slight distance between the starting position of the tongue surface and the upper dental arch. In addition, the vocal cord vibration of English /ʒ/ is more obvious.

![](images/figure15.png)

As long as you read the word "vision" correctly, it means that /v/ and /ʒ/ have passed - at worst, practice "revision" more. (Also, please practice the pronunciation of /ð/ in the following sentences - of course, the pronunciation method of /θ/ is the same.)

> They have a wide field of **vision** and, like most grazing animals, they are especially good at detecting movement. (Sentence 5 from the end of the 75th paragraph)

> Then you can make the necessary **revisions** and hand in your final outline, which is due two weeks from today. (10th sentence of the 23rd paragraph)

There is also a small trick, which is to practice in reverse using Chinese (this trick has been used once before). Replace all [zh] in the following sentence with /ʒ/, and practice repeatedly.

> Zhou Zhi, stand up straight for me!

Once you can say this sentence in a way that sounds like a foreigner speaking Chinese, then you've mastered /ʒ/.

## 23. Pitch

Note, what we're going to talk about in this section is not "intonation," not "tone," but "pitch."

According to David Allen Stern's theory, the most commonly used natural speech pattern by English users is the "Step-up-and-step-down pattern." Simply put, the pitch of the stressed syllable at the beginning will be raised, and the pitch of the following syllables will gradually decrease. And the so-called "beginning" doesn't necessarily have to be the beginning of the sentence. When a sentence is long enough, the speaker will divide the sentence into several units according to the semantic group, and there will be more or less obvious pauses between each unit (at least you have to take a breath to continue speaking, right?) —— If this is the case, then each semantic group may have a syllable with a raised pitch, and the pitch of the following syllables will gradually decrease.

Take this sentence for example:

> **Community** service is an important component of education here at our university. We encourage **all** students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. A **new** community program called “One On One” **helps** elementary students who’ve fallen behind.

Please carefully distinguish the pitch of the stressed syllables in the above emphasized words: "Community", "all", "new", "helps".

So far, the basic knowledge that has been mastered can enable students to fully grasp the rhythm of English.

* The length of each vowel should be appropriate
* Distinguish between stressed and unstressed words in speech flow
* Pause at the appropriate position
* The tone pattern is appropriate
* The stressed syllable at the beginning of the semantic group has a relatively higher pitch

With such a grasp, plus a deep understanding of the key phonemes detailed in this series of articles (consonants /t/, /d/, /s/, /l/, /θ/, /ð/, /v/, and /ʒ/; vowels /ʌ/, /æ/, and all diphthongs), you are already well-equipped to reshape your pronunciation. Being your own mentor is not that difficult.

## 24. First Comprehensive Practice

Finally, we can use the knowledge we just learned to fully analyze and imitate. Follow the steps below to process the text while listening repeatedly:

* Is a sentence read in one breath? If not, where are there obvious or subtle pauses?
* Identify which words are stressed?
* In the stressed words, what is the pitch of each syllable?
* Which stressed word carries a noticeably higher pitch?
* In the unstressed words, which vowels have changed significantly, moving towards /ə/?
* Where are the words linked, and where are the stresses in the preceding and following syllables?
* Are there any consonants like /t/, /k/, /p/ that are not exploded? Also, are there any final consonants (such as /d/, /g/, /b/, etc.) that are only paused and not heard because they are followed by a word beginning with a consonant?
* Is there a voiced /t/ present?

Take the TOEFL listening test recording files, listen to each sentence repeatedly with the help of software, try to answer the above questions, and then make corresponding marks on the text - mark the text in your hand into something like a score, and then you can deliberately imitate.

The following is an analysis record of a complete TOEFL listening recording text:

> Community service is an important component of education here at our university.

* "Community" is stressed, and the syllable /mju:/ is accompanied by a relatively higher pitch;
* "service is" is linked, sounding like the plural "services" of the word "service";
* In "an important component of", "important" and "component" are both stressed. In "important", /pɔ:/ is pronounced "first tone", and the end /t/ is not exploded; in "component", /pəu/ is pronounced "fourth tone", /nənt/ "second tone"; "of" is linked with the previous "component" and is weakly read as /əf/;
* In "here at our university", the original flow should be /ˈhɪə-æt-auə-juniˈvə:siti/. In the end, "here" is stressed, "fourth tone"; "university" is stressed, with /və:/ as "first tone"; at is weakly read as /ət/; "our" is also weakly read, becoming very short, /auə/; and in "at", the /ə/, because the word "here" that was stressed before ends with /ə/, so it is assimilated (or understood as "omitted"), and the /t/ in "at", the front is a vowel (/ə/), and the following is also a vowel (/auə/), so this /t/ is voiced. In the end, the whole breath group sounds like this: /ˈhɪə-dauə-juniˈvə:siti/.

> We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate.

* "Encourage" is pronounced as /inˌkəˌri:ʤ/; the syllable /ri:ʤ/ is stressed with a high tone;
* "All" is stressed with a mid tone;
* "To" is weakly pronounced, almost like /t/;
* The stress in "volunteer" is on the last syllable /tɪə/, which is elongated;
* Both /t/s in "for at least" are not exploded; "for" is weakly pronounced as /fɚ/;
* "One" is stressed with a high tone;
* "Community activity" is weakly pronounced, all long vowels are shortened, and both /iti/ at the ends of the words are pronounced like /ədɪ/ (here /d/ represents a voiced /t/)
* "Before" is stressed with a high tone;
* "They" is weakly pronounced as /ðɪ/, even close to /ð/;
* "Graduate" is stressed with a high tone.

> A new community program called “One On One” helps elementary students who’ve fallen behind.

* "New" is stressed with a mid tone, and is accompanied by a relatively higher tone;
* In "program", /pəu/ has a high tone, and /græm/ has a low tone, slightly elongated;
* "Called" is stressed, elongated, with a low tone;
* In "One on One", the second "One" is stressed with a high tone; the previous "One on" is linked;
* In "helps elementary students", "helps elementary" is very obviously linked — because the stress in "elementary" is on the first syllable; the "p" in "help" is not exploded; the trick to pronouncing it is, when you get to /help /, after pronouncing /hel/, close your lips, pause for a moment (you can exaggerate the pause to two or three seconds when practicing), and then directly open your lips to pronounce /ˈselɪ-men-təri/ (the first syllable is pronounced with a mid tone); in addition, "help" has a relatively higher tone;
* In "who’ve fallen behind", the /v/ in "who’ve", because it is followed by the same lip shape /f/, is not pronounced, but there is no airflow vibration, the length of the sound is still maintained, so it sounds like there is a little pause after "who", and then the "fallen" with a mid tone is pronounced; "behind" is stressed with a high tone.

> You who are majoring in education might be particularly interested in it because it provides the opportunity to do some teaching — that is, tutoring in math and English.

> You would have to volunteer two hours a week for one semester.

> You can choose to help a child with math, English, or both.

> Half-hour lessons are fine, so you could do a half hour of each subject two days a week.

> Professor Dodge will serve as a mentor to the tutors.

> He will be available to assist you with lesson plans or to provide suggestions for activities.

> He has office hours every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon.

> You can register for the program with him and start tutoring next week.

> I'm confident that you'll find this community service rewarding and gain valuable experience at the same time.

> It also looks good on your resume — demonstrating that you've had experience with children and that you care about your community.

* "Looks good" has a subtle pause but no sound in the /k/;
* "Resume", "re" is "fourth tone", /meɪ/ is "second tone";
* "Too" is "fourth tone".
* There is a noticeable pause after "children"; this word, like the previously discussed "program", is "fourth tone" in the first syllable and "first tone" in the second syllable;
* "And" is stressed, "fourth tone";
* "Care about" is linked.

> If you're interested in signing up, or if you have any questions, stop by Professor Dodge's office this week.

* There is no sound in the /d/ of "you'd like to", and there is not even a pause;
* After finishing /saɪ-nʌ/ in "sign up", close your mouth, pause slightly, and directly open your mouth to say "or if you have any question" (spoken very quickly);
* After "Dodge" is added with the possessive "'s", the whole is read /dɔ-ʤɜs/

## 25. About Accents and Foreign Teachers

In the above series of articles "Reshaping Your Own Voice", I chose to use the TOEFL listening test recording as teaching material. Some readers may want to learn "standard British English" rather than "American English". In that case, you can use the official IELTS materials (so-called "Sword 1" to "Sword 7" - *Cambridge IELTS 1-7*, which can probably be bought in Xinhua Bookstores everywhere, many of which have recordings with complete texts) as training materials.

The principles of pronunciation of British English and American English are roughly the same, and the differences in details are not large - the differences between British English and American English have been exaggerated by many people, and the impact of the differences between British English and American English on speakers has been exaggerated to be overly mysterious.

First of all, unless you started speaking English from a young age, then nine out of ten times you will end up speaking not standard American English, not standard British English, but International English (international accent). Secondly, who will care so much about your accent? Besides, whether communication is good or not, the role of voice only accounts for a very small part of it; and within the role of voice, the role of accent accounts for a very small part. So, in the end, just the accent itself hardly affects good communication - although no one denies that the more authentic the accent, the better, at least it feels better to oneself.

Good communication requires
* Thinking ability - you'd better have the ability to consider issues from the other person's perspective;
* Organizational ability - what you say first and what you say later may have completely different effects;
* Observational ability - you should have basic EQ, right? You need to see who says what, or at least need to adjust the way you speak;
* Textual Understanding Ability - Not only should you be able to hear clearly, but you should also understand what the other person is saying, and whether there are any hidden meanings.

Ideally, you should also have
* Sufficient Knowledge Reserves - Even if your pronunciation is perfect, what's the point if you lack basic common sense? Who would want to just greet you and chat about the weather, and then not know what to say?

English is just a medium of expression. Many people have developed "mute English" not because they lack English training (or oral English training) as many teachers or training classes say, but because they lack some or all of the abilities just mentioned. Think about it, what's scary is not "not being able to speak," but "having nothing to say." Even if your pronunciation is good and your accent is authentic, what's the point if you have nothing to say? Not being able to speak is easy to solve, just look up a dictionary (it's strange why so many people think looking up a dictionary is useless? - **I will prove later how indispensable and useful looking up a dictionary is.**); it's okay if you don't speak well, as long as people understand you (how can grammatical errors be eliminated all at once? But most errors can be slowly corrected). However, how to solve the problem of having nothing to say? That's not something you can solve by paying some money to attend a training class.

Many people, because they understand the importance of English, then want to "only learn English," which is the fundamental reason for not learning well. Because English is hard to exist independently, in fact, no language can exist independently, because any language is used to express thoughts and convey information. A single word placed there (not in a paragraph) is similar to a brick (not a building) - in some sense, it's even worse than a brick, because at least a brick can be used to fight; a word? At most it can be used to curse people, and if you're not careful, it might even provoke a beating. Many people instinctively think that it's reasonable to only learn "the most important thing," but this idea is not wrong, it's just that they have confused or reversed the important and the secondary. Think about it, which of the abilities mentioned earlier is harder to learn than pronunciation (or even language), and which is harder to accumulate than pronunciation? Even practicing one's mother tongue is not an easy task!

I've always felt that it's not necessary to have a foreigner to practice with. Many people have spent a lot of money to attend those "foreign teacher classes." Those who have been there know that the effect is not as great as imagined. The reason is very simple, foreign teachers can only teach the basics. As for those more important abilities that need to be used in combination with language and text, they are also powerless. Foreign teachers are just native speakers of foreign languages. In their group, more than half of the people have poor thinking ability, weak observation ability, lack of organization ability, poor textual understanding ability, and serious lack of knowledge reserves - they will not automatically be stronger than us just because they come from Western countries.

Sometimes, having the opportunity to go shopping and chat with foreigners may also bring harm to yourself. Because foreigners are also people (very intelligent!), and they are also very polite, so often, even if you don't speak well (for example, the pronunciation is wrong, the stress position is wrong, the subject and predicate are inconsistent, etc.) they can still understand; even if it's foggy, they can also use the scene at the time, the topic of discussion, and the other person's body language to guess eight or nine out of ten. So, inadvertently, you have the illusion that "my spoken English is not bad! The communication is very good!" - "Good communication" is indeed a fact, however, the reason is not necessarily because your spoken English is good enough. Especially when beautiful girls meet foreign men, it is even more so. I have seen many people, because they feel "I have no problem communicating with foreigners," they feel that they do not need to deliberately prepare for the exam, and only after getting the TOEFL score did they find that their spoken English score was surprisingly low, and then they were "baffled."

Reshaping one's pronunciation can be entirely self-reliant. In fact, like me, many people ultimately find that they can only rely on themselves. It's not even that they don't want to rely on others. Aren't we the majority? So, like most people, aren't we without conditions? So, isn't it because we can't rely on others that we have to rely on ourselves?

## 26. Specific Steps for Shadowing Training

After getting the material for shadowing, the first step is to read the text carefully. All unfamiliar words should be looked up, then determine the exact meaning of the word in the current sentence, and then write it down on the side of the text. Of course, today we also have MS Word, which can easily add "annotations" to the text. And in Word, there is also a built-in dictionary, which is very useful... If every word is looked up and still can't understand the sentence, there is often a phrase, look it up one by one.

When looking up each unfamiliar word, you should record the stress and vowel length (if necessary, write down the entire phonetic symbol, or you can use simplified notation). My practice is to add a stress mark (stress /ˈ/ and secondary stress /ˌ/) in front of the stressed syllable, and draw a horizontal line above the letters that form long vowels and diphthongs - those without a horizontal line are short vowels. If we use a word processor like MS Word, we can use this notation: mark the stressed syllables with "bold" (CTRL+B), and underline the letters that form long vowels and diphthongs (CTRL+U).

The second step is to listen to the recording repeatedly and make natural flow correction marks. When I just looked up the dictionary, what I found was the pronunciation of individual words; their pronunciation in natural flow will change in this way and that way. Based on the mechanism mentioned before, it is easy to recognize these changes. Circle the stressed words; mark the syllables where the tone is raised (I usually use a small triangle); some syllables have a noticeably different tone, mark them with "1", "2", "4"; draw a vertical line at the pause; then pay attention to where there is a burst, where there is voicing, where there is a connection... When marking, you need to imitate it. Sometimes, you must imitate it to find out that you just heard it wrong.

Now, we have a "score". We know how long each sound is - which one was long but is now short, which one was not long but is now a bit longer; we know the strength and weakness of each sound; we know which sounds are as complete as any sound but do not have airflow vibration or vocal cord vibration, or both; we know where there is a pause, where the tone is special, where there is a rising tone...

So, we can start the third step. Repeat the shadowing. At the beginning, you can play a sentence of the recording, follow it several times, and correct yourself carefully on the premise of reading aloud. After getting familiar, play a sentence of the recording and follow a sentence, and after getting a little more familiar, do "asynchronous" reading. The so-called asynchronous reading is "slow beat shadowing". After hearing a word in the recording, we start again, and what we repeat in our mouth is the word that was just finished in the recording, and what we hear in our ears at the same time is our own voice and the next word said in the recording, and then repeat it. When the recording finishes a sentence, we say another word and it ends just right. This training can subtly improve our English instant memory. After getting familiar to a certain extent, you can do "synchronous" reading.

The fourth step is to correct the recording. Every once in a while, you can record your reading voice and save it, and then listen to it again after a week. Many people work twice as hard because they listen to it immediately after recording, but in this case, there is basically no room for correction - because there is no change between you after the recording and before the recording. At that time, you thought that was the right way to say it, so you said it that way. Just two or three minutes later, you can't possibly make a huge or even sufficient progress; so, you who haven't changed, actually can't hear where you are wrong, and don't have the ability to correct yourself. However, you have been practicing, practicing every day, and a week later, even if your progress is not huge, it is enough, so you may easily hear where you have made mistakes in the past.

At such times, the thought that often flashes in your mind is this: "My God, how could I make such a (low-level) mistake!" Deep impressions often only come from two directions, 1) a lot of repetition; 2) unexpected discovery. And just now, that kind of thought will make you "feel" unexpected, so once this thought flashes out, you have made great progress - because you will hardly make the same mistake in the future, because you have a deep impression. Of course, it still needs to be recorded, because our memory is unreliable. There is also this deep in the clichés of elementary school teachers, such as this: a good memory is not as good as a bad pen.

The last step is recitation. Students often ask me, how many times do I have to read an article? My answer is at least 60 times. A TOEFL listening recording is about 90 seconds long, and if you are moderately proficient, you can complete it in about three to five minutes with continuous reading and repeated imitation. If you average 5 minutes per time, 60 times is 5 hours. One hour a day, from Monday to Friday, you can finish it. Many students give up when they hear such a requirement. Such people cannot succeed in this matter, because they are like those who are doomed to fail in this matter "demand too much for short-term gains and too little for long-term gains."

After reading for a week and reading dozens of times (there are also subtle imitations and corrections, so it is actually hundreds of times), as long as you spend a few more minutes, you can memorize the article without a word. Since you have done it, please do your homework according to what I said. You must recite it. As for why you should recite it, there will be detailed explanations later. It's actually not troublesome. In this way, about 10 articles (you can rest on Saturdays and Sundays!) are enough. It's only ten weeks. Ten weeks later, your voice, rhythm, memory, comprehension, etc. are all different. The so-called "rebirth" is nothing more than this.

## 27. An Important Reason for Wasting Life - Low Requirements

Students all want to learn well, but most of them ultimately fail to learn well based on various reasons - internal and external. If you learn well, you will benefit for life. In a certain sense, it may even benefit generations to come - although knowledge cannot be inherited through genes, if parents are experts in a certain field, then children will naturally gain more and deeper knowledge in that field due to the influence of their growth process. On the contrary, if you have learned but not learned well, the loss is also huge. Because the learning process consumes not only money and energy, but more importantly, the time that is ruthlessly passing and never returning. Time is generally an exclusive resource, and it is difficult to do another thing well while doing one thing. If you spend time without gaining, it is equivalent to wasting life. And in the ten years of school life, it's okay if you don't learn, but if you try hard to learn but don't learn English well, it means that a considerable part of your youth has been wasted. Wasting life is already terrifying, and wasting youth is not only terrifying but also pitiful.

One of the most serious yet hidden reasons why most people ultimately fail in learning English might be this: most people demand too much for short-term gains and too little for long-term benefits.

In terms of learning English, quick success is impossible. However, quick success is the goal of most people - of course, most people are not clearly aware that this is their "short-term" goal, but because of the word "quick", their goal has automatically become a "short-term goal" - demanding high short-term gains to an unattainable extent. Overall, while most people admit that patience is a necessary quality for success, they secretly hope that they are an exception - others can't achieve quick success, but they can. They usually don't want to admit their impatience for quick success. However, the fact is very clear. Just look at the course composition of English training institutions in society, and you will know that there are nine out of ten short-term training courses, and some institutions even if they set up long-term training are actually deserted. In fact, even those short-term training classes are getting shorter and shorter. Ten years ago, the TOEFL/GRE exam training class was set to about 40 class hours, each class hour was 2.5 hours, a few years ago it was shortened to 32 class hours, and then it was shortened to 24 class hours. Now some training institutions are set to 24 class hours, each class hour is 2 hours. Although the motivation for commercial training institutions to reduce costs is very high, overall, their motivation to cater to customers is even higher. Therefore, in a sense, even short-term training classes are getting shorter and shorter, which is the result of customers voting with banknotes.

From another angle, it seems that no one thinks that they can use English as proficiently as their mother tongue through long-term accumulation - it seems that this is completely impossible. In fact, as long as the timing is right, the method is correct, and a certain degree of accumulation, it is possible to use several languages proficiently at the same time. I am a born bilingual user - I am Korean, and both Korean and Chinese are my mother tongues - so we have known from a young age that it is not surprising to use two languages with equal proficiency. In fact, many people on the earth (especially in border areas, such as Luxembourg) are born multilingual users, but people generally believe that they must grow up in such an environment. But this is not the case. In recent years, I have to tutor many high school students to apply to American universities every year. The TOEFL/SAT scores of these high school graduates may make many English majors in domestic universities blush, and they can easily encounter a high school student who has not attended any training class, has not specially prepared for the exam, and the TOEFL exam with a full score of 120 points can easily get a score of more than 110. However, even if their English standardized test scores are high, there is still a big lack of proficiency in English. However, as long as they go to the United States to study for one or two years, English will be completely "nativized". Most of them, from the moment they go to the United States to study, start learning another foreign language, such as French, German or Spanish, and within one or two years, they have become standard "Trilingual" (three-language users).
