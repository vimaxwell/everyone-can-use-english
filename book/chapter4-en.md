# Chapter 4: Reading Aloud

## 1. The Oldest and Most Effective Training Method

Before the advent of written language, humans were already capable of speech, albeit not as complex, and what needed to be said was quite simple. With the development of written language and eventually the mastery of logic, what people could think of and needed to express became increasingly complex. In a sense, the ultimate possession of written language is the most profound essential difference between humans and other closely related species. Once humans possessed written language, conscious, purposeful education became a necessity.

And all cultures are the same in this respect: **Reading aloud is the oldest, most widespread, least costly, and most effective training method in language education**. It's a pity that even in our mother tongue education, this best training method is not given enough emphasis. And every generation thinks they can find a better method, ignoring this actually unsurpassable means.

Over the years, I have been making progress, but I have never felt that I have learned English well (at least not in the way that people generally think of as "good"), but in the process of learning, I really didn't feel that it was so hard. This is thanks to my father. My father is a man proficient in multiple languages. He graduated from the Russian Department of Heilongjiang University, was sent down to teach English at Hailin County No. 1 Middle School not long after the Cultural Revolution, and later was "implemented policy" and transferred to the head of the Foreign Language Department of Yanbian Medical College until retirement. Because my father is an English professor, I was appointed as the "English class representative" as soon as I entered junior high school. My homeroom teacher mistakenly thought that because my father was an English professor, my English would naturally be good — a big mistake.

There's a saying, "Physicians heal thyself." Similarly, my dad was an incredibly patient teacher with his students, but when it came to teaching his own son at home, he would lose his patience after a couple of sentences and start scolding, "You little rascal, are you really my son? You're so slow!" Of course, I wouldn't back down either, "Didn't you say you picked me up from somewhere!" And so, we would part on bad terms. At that time, I felt that his proficiency in English was his business, and my lack of it was still his problem.

But I had already become the "English class representative." Every morning, I had to stand in front of the entire class to lead the reading of the text. If I stuttered, it would be very embarrassing. So, I had no choice but to grit my teeth and ask my dad for help. In that era (around 1984), English textbooks did not come with accompanying tapes (let alone the convenient mp3s we have now). Since my dad was the head of the foreign language department, we had a tape recorder at home quite early on. He managed to get two blank imported TDK tapes under the guise of official business, and recorded all the textbook readings for me. From then on, I would spend a few dozen minutes at home getting familiar with the text by following the tape, and then go to school to lead the reading, finally managing to avoid embarrassment.

The middle school textbook was very simple, starting with "This is a book. That is a table." There weren't many units in a book, and it would take a week (or even longer) for the teacher to finish one unit. So, every sentence in the textbook, I didn't know how many times I had to lead the class in reading. Soon, I found that after leading the reading three or five times, I could basically memorize the text. After I finished reading a sentence and waited for my classmates to follow along, I could naturally recall what the next sentence was — I could even stand in front and lead the reading without bringing the book.

For many years thereafter, I never paid serious attention in English class, yet I never did poorly on exams. When doing multiple-choice questions, I simply chose the option that "rolled off the tongue," and my accuracy rate was incredibly high, almost never making a mistake. Before long, I found that when classmates asked me why only one option could be chosen for a question, if I answered truthfully, I would often attract skeptical looks. So, I started to spout jargon I learned from the teacher: "Ah, it's a matter of language sense..." Strangely enough, when they received this inexplicable answer, the questioners would often look thoughtful, then slowly nod their heads and walk away in silence.

Many years later, I inexplicably became an English teacher myself. Upon serious reflection, I realized that I had picked up a great bargain: I had unknowingly used the lowest-cost, most effective training method and avoided countless pitfalls.

## 2. Reading Aloud Helps Improve Text Comprehension

Regrettably, most people do not value reading aloud training - this is true in the acquisition process of both their mother tongue and foreign languages. Reading aloud training is simple and effective, and it can solve many problems that many people spend a lot of money on various training classes to solve.

Reading aloud training is the most effective way to improve text comprehension. Imagine now that you have to fluently read a sentence composed of twenty words.

First of all, every time you see a word, you must have the ability to recognize it. Some words look very similar, such as "principle" and "principal", "quite" and "quiet" - even whether there is a space is a factor to consider, such as "some time" and "sometimes", or "everyone" and "every one"...

Secondly, most words have multiple meanings. The specific meaning of a word in a given sentence depends on the meaning of the words adjacent to it. For example, the word "scale" has many meanings. If it is followed by "~ of the economy," it means "scale"; if it is followed by "~ of fish," it should mean "fish scale"...

Next, some combinations of words express meanings that are almost entirely different from their literal meanings, such as "strike home," "even Steven," "paint the town red," and so on. It's not too bad if you don't understand at all, but sometimes it's difficult when the actual meaning is exactly the opposite of the intuitive feeling. For example, "birds of prey." Students who only know the word "prey" and haven't specifically looked up the dictionary might interpret this phrase as "birds being preyed upon," but the correct meaning is "carnivorous birds, birds of prey." (Don't be surprised, believe me, you're not alone.)

Furthermore, if a sentence exceeds ten words in length, it is more likely to be a complex sentence, with phrases, clauses, possibly inverted or emphatic sentences, and there may also be omitted grammatical components. These grammatical phenomena are not always easy to handle, and occasionally it takes some effort to get them right.
The reason why reading aloud is the most basic method to improve "comprehension ability" is because when a person can fluently read a sentence, it means that he is in the process of "deconstructing" and "reconstructing" the sentence - this is a complex system engineering task.

> Information enters through the eyes, is recognized, understood, and processed by the brain, and then uses various organs in the mouth to form the correct sound, which is then fed back to the brain through the ears. At the same time, the brain is constantly processing: what are the components of the sentence, which words form what kind of components, what do these components mean, what is the relationship between the components, and what meaning do these components form when combined, and so on.

> Conversely, if a reader faces a grammatically correct, logically rigorous sentence and cannot read it fluently, it means that the reader's "deconstruction" is wrong or the "reconstruction" is wrong. After re-understanding the sentence structure, component meaning, and their relationships, the sentence becomes naturally clear, and reading it becomes "smooth"; then read the sentence several more times - in fact, it is "repeatedly practicing the understanding process, consolidating the understanding ability".

In fact, most people find it difficult to read any sentence fluently in their native language - even though most people think they can. For example, perhaps most people can read any sentence in the "Reader" magazine quite fluently without any preparation - because it is just a literacy magazine; however, only a few people (probably very few) can read any sentence in the "Reading" magazine fluently without any preparation - because this kind of magazine conveys knowledge that truly requires intelligence to understand. Even professional broadcasters need to spend some time familiarizing themselves with the content before they can read any material without making basic mistakes.

> My comments on "Reader" and "Reading" are just my personal opinion. Also, it seems that "Reading" has already ceased publication?

"Reading aloud" is even a skill, and naturally, it needs to be mastered through practice. Although not everyone needs to do it to the extreme (except for those who eventually become broadcasters or actors), if they can't even pass this, it may lead to a decline in "comprehension ability", and even all subjects may be affected. Readers might as well recall their own growth process. In each class, there are at least one or two students who are ridiculed by teachers or classmates because of their poor reading aloud. Generally, their grades in other subjects are unlikely to be ideal - because learning any subject requires reading text and understanding ability. But these children can't even read fluently, their understanding ability is naturally much worse, so they may lag behind others in all subjects. This is almost an iron law: childhood text training affects a person's thinking ability for life, and then affects the quality of life.

## 3. Reading aloud training will subtly improve reading comprehension speed

Usually, we don't care about our reading speed, especially when reading leisure books, "speed" is almost not a factor to consider - fast and slow depend on personal preference. Some people like to chew on words, some people just like to swallow dates - of course, more people simply don't bother to read, only look at pictorials and movies. People really care about their reading speed, basically when they are taking exams, such as participating in foreign language exams such as the domestic CET-4 and CET-6 or foreign study exams TOEFL, SAT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT - most people's direct feeling is that the reading speed is too slow, and even the time is not enough. Although exams have never been liked by people, excellent exam scores are often a pass for a person's development and have to work hard for it. Of course, in work, input is very important, so if a person's reading comprehension speed is not fast enough, it will limit a person's ability to a large extent - because his speed of obtaining, filtering, and selecting information, and the amount and quality of information obtained are all limited to some extent.

In order to address the limitation of reading speed, people (including teachers and students) have proposed various solutions and suggestions, and have also defined many so-called "bad habits," such as "lip reading," "finger reading," "rereading," "translating reading," and so on. Many students, when faced with problems, inevitably resort to desperate measures, believing that "lip reading," "finger reading," and other methods are indeed the so-called bad habits. In fact, no matter how absurd something is, as long as someone is willing to assert it categorically, there will be people (many people) who believe it without thinking. Don't we encounter such examples every day?

However, these "speed reading" suggestions are essentially palliative, as they only solve the problem of input speed, not the problem of comprehension speed after input. No matter how fast the input speed is, if the comprehension speed can't keep up, what's the point? Sometimes it's a bit puzzling why so many people clearly want to improve their "reading comprehension speed" in their minds, but in actual "reading," they only care about "speed" and simply ignore the importance of "comprehension"? (Perhaps it's caused by the habit of "skimming, skipping"? Accidentally skipped over the word "comprehension" and simply didn't see it... This is a good example of the negative consequences of a well-intentioned but imprecise suggestion.)

Only seeing the surface, never delving into the essence, is the root cause of all problems not being solved. The bottleneck of reading comprehension speed lies in comprehension speed, not input speed.

There are at least the following common ways of "input":

* Skimming: Just quickly browsing the text with your eyes (essentially, this is bound to omit some information at the cost)
* Silent Reading: While scanning the text with your eyes, a voice in your mind "reads" these words without actually making a sound.
* Lip Reading: While scanning the text with your eyes, your lips move to "speak" these words.
* Reading Aloud: You read the words you see out loud.

In reality, no one uses only one of the above four input methods all the time - whether reading in their native language or a foreign language. On the contrary, everyone unconsciously chooses their input method based on their needs. When the reading content is relatively simple for the reader (i.e., the reader's comprehension ability is relatively strong in this regard), they often adopt the "scanning" method. When the content is a bit more challenging, they will use the "silent reading" method. If the content is relatively difficult, they will naturally adopt the "lip reading" method - because this can slow down the speed, allowing more time for thinking and digestion. So, whether it's "scanning", "silent reading", or "lip reading", they are all just input methods, each with its own use, and not bad habits at all. If students believe that "lip reading" and "silent reading" are bad habits, they are essentially like a "three-legged cat that has had two legs cut off" - in other words, it's "adding insult to injury".

The same is true for everyone: the difficulty of the reading content is inversely proportional to the reading comprehension speed, i.e., the higher the difficulty of the content being read, the slower the reader's comprehension speed. And the input method we are using ("scanning", "silent reading", and "lip reading") will inevitably match the comprehension speed. Therefore, once the reader starts using "lip reading", it indicates that the difficulty of the content being read has reached a certain level, and under such difficulty, the reader's "comprehension speed" is less than or equal to the "lip reading" speed - if the comprehension speed is even worse, the reader may need to "re-read" several times, or even go back to a previous point (the previous sentence, the previous paragraph, or even the previous page) to find clues that can guide them back on track.

Text is inherently vocal, simply because most people are neither deaf nor mute. Therefore, it is impossible to avoid sound when understanding text. If you introspect your so-called "skimming" process, you will find that the voice in your mind has always been there. Essentially, the intermittent nature of the voice during "skimming" is merely because some "content that can be correctly inferred without reading in full" has been "skipped" during the reading process. That voice only "reads" those "contents that must be read so as not to affect understanding" - it could be sentences or just fragments. Furthermore, if a person is normal, they can at most deliberately avoid "lip reading", but they cannot avoid "silent reading" at all.

Most English beginners, when reading a text of a certain difficulty, their "understanding speed" can't even keep up with the "reading aloud speed". In fact, for language ability tests like TOEFL, test-takers only need to achieve an "understanding speed" equivalent to the "reading aloud speed", then they would have ample time in the exam room (whereas exams like SAT, GRE, GMAT require a much higher understanding speed). Since reading aloud can improve text comprehension ability, then reading aloud is an effective training method to improve reading comprehension speed - although it may not seem intuitive from a feeling perspective.

## 4. No need to practice listening specifically, reading aloud is enough

A large amount of reading aloud training can make students not have to practice "listening" specifically. In a sense, it is quite absurd for many students to spend time specifically practicing listening. Normal people who are neither deaf nor mute don't need to specifically train any listening skills, and in fact, they can't - everyone's ear structure is the same, no matter how you train, the auricle won't get bigger, and the eardrum won't get thinner...

In fact, the principle is quite simple: as long as you can speak it, you can understand it - regardless of the language. Therefore, you only need to practice speaking, and there is no need to specifically practice listening. Many people's so-called "poor listening skills" are actually caused by poor speaking. However, they abandon the root and seek the end, they just don't speak, and then specifically practice listening, isn't this absurd? In fact, even if you don't speak well, you can still understand. For example, in many regions of our country, people do not speak Mandarin very standardly, their speech is mixed with a heavy local accent, and even uses a lot of local specific vocabulary, but have you ever met any of them who complained to you that they couldn't understand the news broadcast on CCTV?

On this point, external training institutions appear even more absurd, they often provide students with specialized "listening" teachers. As a commercial institution, this practice is not surprising at all, it is easy to understand - catering to their preferences makes money. But in fact, that is completely a waste of student time, and of course, it also wastes the student's money - but from another perspective, it is also the student voluntarily wasting time and money, it is completely Zhou Yu hitting Huang Gai. In these training institutions, we never see any listening teacher advocating that students improve their so-called "listening" by practicing speaking - because if they do that, wouldn't they be grabbing the rice bowl of the oral teacher?

Many "listening" teachers tout and even deify the benefits of "dictation" training - although they do not intend to deceive, in fact, they may really believe that their method is the most effective. However, dictation training is almost the most time-consuming and ineffective so-called method. Students often ask questions like this: "Teacher, I have been dictating for three months, why haven't I improved?" At this time, I am very confused, thinking in my heart: "You have used three months to perfectly prove that this method is ineffective, why are you still asking me why it is ineffective?"

In the field of English teaching, there are far more absurd "methods" than the "miracle cures" that are hyped up in the medical field. At least in modern medicine, there is the method of double-blind testing to determine whether a drug is truly effective. However, in the field of English teaching, it is difficult to use double-blind testing (or any other similar method) to make an effectiveness judgment. As for why "dictation" training is ineffective, it can actually be explained clearly with just two sentences (though they may be a bit crude): 1) If you can't understand it, what's the point of writing it down? 2) If you can understand it, what's the point of writing it down? This simple fact doesn't need to be "controversial."

In fact, Listening Comprehension and Reading Comprehension are similar, with the emphasis more on Comprehension, rather than just Listening or Reading. What is heard with the ears must ultimately be understood, otherwise it is meaningless. And the so-called "listening practice" is essentially a measure that treats the symptoms but not the root cause.

## 5. Reading Aloud Can Improve Language and Text Memory Skills

Reading aloud training will unconsciously improve our language and text memory skills. The methods we use to remember faces, song tunes, or paragraphs of articles are all different. Because we can't possibly read the same sentence or the same article over and over again for a lifetime, we will inevitably encounter various writing patterns, rhythms, and combinations. A certain amount of repetition will inevitably produce deep memory. Therefore, in the process of a large amount of reading aloud training, we will naturally call upon various memory methods that we may need, such as pattern-based, sound-based, text-based, and so on.

In learning any foreign language, we ultimately need to be able to memorize passages and paraphrase the main ideas fluently in that language. This requires a basic ability: memory. When learning English, that's English memory. When I interview English teachers, I basically only ask them to do one thing: recite a passage they have read thoroughly. If you were in my shoes, you would quickly find that such a simple requirement quickly filters out most applicants - most people can't recite any passage over 100 words. Without this basic English memory ability, how can one possibly use English fluently?

Years of special work experience have turned me into a "test machine". Many people are surprised at the speed at which I do reading questions. In the past, when taking the TOEFL test, we could finish the questions that were supposed to be done within 55 minutes in about 25 minutes. Why? In fact, our reading speed is not fast, but we can understand it at a glance, and we can remember most of it. So when doing the questions, it will be very fast. Take a question, look at option A, and you know it must be wrong, because it is obviously the opposite of what you just saw; then look at option B, and you immediately know that you can't choose it, because it was not mentioned in the article you just read; then look at option C, it is it, it looks like it is just a paraphrase of the original text; at this time, you don't even need to look at option D, because this is a four-choice question, there is already a correct answer, the rest must be wrong...

Let me describe why many candidates feel that there is never enough time. In fact, they don't read slowly, but they don't fully understand after reading, let alone remember. When doing the questions, look at option A, think, I seem to have seen this, but where is it? So go back to the article to find it, look for it, scan the article again, but can't find it! So panic... In fact, their reading speed is very fast, but they just can't fully understand, let alone have memory, so, the article has been read many times, but there is no way to judge which is the correct answer.

The TOEFL exam is currently one of the most authoritative English proficiency tests. The current TOEFL exam includes listening, speaking, reading, and writing sections, and no matter which section it is, test-takers need to have sufficient English memory skills to score high. Many people perform poorly in the TOEFL listening test not because they "didn't understand," but because they "actually understood, but by the time they heard the question, they couldn't remember what they had just understood." We've already discussed the impact of memory on reading scores, so let's look at the impact of memory on the speaking and writing sections. Whether it's speaking or writing, both sections of the exam include what's called the "integrated test section," that is, outputting—speaking or writing—based on the content just input after listening or reading (or listening first then reading, or reading first then listening). An important ability tested in the so-called "integrated test" is the "accurate, comprehensive ability to retell details." Without basic memory skills, where does one start with retelling?

If you're taking exams like the GMAT (these exams are essentially not English exams, but logic exams, they just use English), test-takers with poor memory skills are even worse off. Those questions all have five options (not four), and each option could be a complex sentence spanning three to four lines, and then the question might be asked like this: "Among the following A, B, C, D, E five options, which statement, if established, would seriously weaken the viewpoint in the article?" Without basic memory skills, how can you get this kind of question right? ——Don't even think about it.

We often struggle to remember information that is meaningless or unconnected. For instance, memorizing more than 100 digits after the decimal point in Pi is challenging, likely more so than memorizing a 200-word article. A person's ability to remember text largely depends on their ability to understand it. During the process of reading aloud, not only does one's understanding of the text subtly improve, but their ability to remember it also significantly increases. We've all had the experience where after repeatedly reading the same article many times, we naturally memorize it. This is because "reading a book a thousand times reveals its meaning" - once understood, it's easy to remember. And by reading aloud a variety of articles, we're actually repeating similar "patterns", thereby subtly storing information in our memory bank.

Conversely, a person's memory also affects their understanding. If you can't remember what you've read before, you can't connect it with the information that comes later. If there isn't enough connection between pieces of information, it becomes hard to understand. Therefore, improving memory promotes the strengthening of understanding, and likewise, the development of understanding also promotes the growth of memory. Memory works like this: the more you remember, the more you can remember. A person's potential for memory development depends on their existing memory. And understanding is the same, the more you've understood, the more you can further understand, a person's potential for understanding development also depends on their existing understanding.

## 6. Reading Aloud Training Can Improve Expressive Ability

Reading aloud training can enhance a person's expressive ability, whether in speech or writing. A large amount of reading aloud will make you unconsciously remember a lot of expressions. The more common and necessary the expressions are, the higher the frequency of their repetition in various articles, and through a lot of repetition, these expressions will slowly be engraved in your mind. According to psychologists, this information will slowly move from the short-term memory area to the long-term memory area, that is, these expressions will gradually become your "built-in" means of expression.

When learning a foreign language, grammar is always one of the biggest difficulties. In English, some nouns have the same singular and plural forms, while others have special plural forms; some verbs may be transitive or intransitive, and if it is used as an intransitive verb, then it must be paired with an appropriate preposition; some verbs can only be followed by the "ing" form, while others can only be followed by the "to do" form... Although these rules are clearly organized in grammar books, it is too difficult to remember them by reading grammar books - otherwise why would so many people still not get full marks after repeatedly taking English exams, and still make mistakes repeatedly? But if you have read aloud similar sentences of those grammar points, then when doing the questions, you will feel that the "correct answer is smooth", and the "wrong answer is awkward"... And when you speak or write at ordinary times, you will naturally use the correct way, instead of "inventing a new kind of English" without even knowing it.

Reading aloud training will also unconsciously cultivate the practitioner's sense of language and text rhythm. In this regard, even in our formal language education system in our mother tongue, it is emphasized too little. Our understanding of the rhythm of the mother tongue text is almost entirely not deliberately learned from school (because schools rarely teach deliberately), but unconsciously acquired in reading aloud. During our growth process, we have read aloud many texts (usually the text is indeed quite elegant), many poems (modern poetry, Tang poetry, Song lyrics, etc.), many people even if they have not read aloud too many articles, poems, but at least will sing Many popular songs (in a sense, the lyrics of most popular songs pursue rhythm in order to be catchy), so when people use their mother tongue, it seems that they "do not need to teach, do not need to learn, do not need to practice" and "naturally" have a certain sense of language and text rhythm.

If you have worked in a publishing house for even one or two days as a text editor, you know that many people write text that is simply unreadable, completely lacking even the most basic sense of text rhythm, and the author obviously does not know how awkward his text is - authors who can submit manuscripts to publishing houses often think that their text is written quite well ... This is the bad result of too little mother tongue reading training. And reading aloud training will make a person unconsciously avoid this embarrassment. As the saying goes, "If you read three hundred Tang poems, you will not be able to write poetry but you will be able to chant", in a sense, it also means this.

## 7. Reading aloud training can improve language and text pattern recognition ability

Reading practice enhances a person's ability to recognize patterns in language and text. Normal people have strong pattern recognition abilities in various aspects. For instance, they can quickly identify which faces are familiar and which are strange among dozens of faces, even if the images they see are not 100% clear or are somewhat distorted. Psychologists have long noticed that English users can instantly distinguish between the words "indicate" and "intricate", even though these two words differ by only one or two letters (the first word is composed of eight letters, the second of nine). This is possible because they are involuntarily using their pattern recognition abilities.

When we use language, whether listening, speaking, reading, or writing, we do not input each word individually, then combine them, and then process them. In fact, we often "process in chunks", that is, we use pattern recognition whenever we can.

Why can we understand that [le – m – gəu] means [let him gəu]? It's not because we recognize each word (let + him + go) and then understand and draw conclusions. It's because in our daily lives, we have said and heard "Let him go" so many times that it has become a whole "module". Moreover, there are auxiliary scenes available for understanding during the process of hearing this sound stream, which makes us seem to understand instantly.

For instance, when we say "I've lost my key!" ("我把钥匙弄丢了！"), we don't process it like this:

* I (me...)
* 've ("have" needs to be connected with "I", so have is abbreviated as 've... The key was just lost, so it should be in the present perfect tense...)
* lost ("lose" is an irregular verb... The past tense and past participle of "lose" are both "lost"...)
* my (The key is mine, not someone else's...)
* key (What I lost is a key, not something else...)

We are more likely to process it like this:

> *I've lost my* (Just realized the key is missing; there might be a pause here because I'm looking for the key...) **key**!

In other words, "I've lost my" is treated as one unit, and "key" is another unit. In daily life, "I've lost my..." has been said countless times, such as:

* I've lost my **key**.
* I've lost my **money**.
* I've lost my **wallet**.
* I've lost my **ticket**.
* I've lost my **job**.
* ...

And we don't even know how many times we've heard similar phrases from others: "I've lost my...". So, when we hear someone say "I've lost my...", our brain's reaction is "What did you lose?", rather than:

* Hearing "I" and then thinking, "You ... what happened?"
* Hearing "'ve" and then thinking, "Oh, what action are you talking about in the present perfect tense? Or what do you 'have'?"
* Hearing "lost" and then thinking, "Oh, so you lost something. You actually used this irregular verb correctly..."
* Hearing "my" and then thinking, "Got it, what did you lose of yours? I thought you lost something of mine..."
* And hearing "key" and then thinking, "Oh, so you just lost your key!"

(Even if we really think this way, the speed of thinking should be so fast that we don't even know we're thinking this way.)

The following two examples can be used to demonstrate the importance of pattern recognition in language application.

The vast majority of Chinese people actually cannot explain in detail the differences and similarities between the two Chinese characters "编" and "织". On one level, the meanings of these two characters are so similar that when put together "编织" it still means the same thing. But the usage of these two words is not exactly the same. We can say about a girl "She knits sweaters", we can also say "She weaves sweaters"; we might say about a boy "He makes up stories", but we would never say "He weaves stories"! ——In other words, even if we can't explain in detail the differences and similarities between "编" and "织", we would never use them incorrectly. A reasonable explanation is that native speakers have encountered a large number of combinations like "knit sweaters", "weave sweaters", "make up stories" in the past, but have never encountered the combination "weave stories", so this "pattern" does not exist in the subconscious.

This is true for native English speakers as well - in fact, it should be the case for everyone when using language. Most people (with the exception of a few linguistics professors) can only clearly state that the difference between "important" and "essential" is a matter of degree, that is, "essential" is equivalent to "very important". The characteristic of the word "essential" - that it usually does not modify people - is something that most people cannot articulate. However, a native English speaker might say, "He is an important teacher in my life," but they would rarely say, "He is an essential teacher in my life." Yet, those who speak English as a second language often make this kind of "mistake."

Native speakers know a lot about their mother tongue that they don't even realize they know - often referred to by the perplexed as "native intuition". The acquisition of such knowledge can only be achieved through "extensive application" and "accumulation over time". For learners of a second language, reading aloud is likely the only way to train their language pattern recognition ability in the absence of an immersive environment. Thus, reading aloud becomes almost the only reliable method. In the process of repeated reading aloud, many "patterns" will involuntarily be etched into the mind, gradually transforming into knowledge that one doesn't even realize they possess - the kind of "language sense" that our English teachers often allude to is naturally cultivated in this way.
