# Chapter 8: Advice

## 1. Quick Success is Impossible

Chinese students often feel that they have been "learning" English for over a decade. When they think about the many years of their youth that have passed, they feel particularly pitiful. Upon second thought, they realize that "pitiful" is a derogatory term, so they begin to describe themselves as "tragically heroic". But in reality, have they truly been learning for all those years? Have they genuinely learned anything during those years? If they don't ask, it's fine, but once they face this question, they realize that the so-called "learning" in the past many years can hardly withstand scrutiny.

In fact, most students don't invest much time in learning English every day. Perhaps there was a period of intense cramming, but there has never been a long-term sustained effort - if there had been, even the worst methods would have had some, or even a significant, positive effect, and they would no longer be troubled by English.

Many years ago, I read an article by Peter Norvig online, "[Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html)". The author believes that people who buy books with titles like "Learn Java in 7 Days" are showing their ignorance. He thinks it's very worthwhile to learn programming in ten years.

> Look at another type of field. The Beatles seemed to suddenly catch fire and become the number one band with their performance at the Ed Sullivan Theater in 1964. But in fact, they started performing in small clubs in Liverpool, Hamburg, and other places as early as 1957. Although they showed strong appeal early on, their decisive success, Sgt Pepper, wasn't released until 1967. Samuel Johnson thought that perhaps even ten years might not be enough, he said: "Excellence in any field can only be achieved with a lifetime of effort; anything less is not enough." Chaucer lamented: "Life is so short, yet learning a craft takes so long."

A few years after Peter Norvig wrote his article (2001), in November 2008, Malcolm Gladwell published his best-selling book "Outliers". In this book, Malcolm Gladwell converted this "ten years" into a more precise "10,000 hours" - if you want to excel, you need to strive for at least ten thousand hours. Let's calculate, with 365 days in a year, if the time spent on learning English every day consistently remains at three hours, then just over nine years would be enough to accumulate a "driving mileage" of 10,000 hours; if it's four hours a day, then less than seven years would suffice. If it's six hours a day, about four and a half years would be enough.

If you are struggling with learning English, you might want to ask yourself, how long have you been consistently striving over the past many years? The root of the problem lies here. Also, please pay special attention to the word "consistent". If you sprint for less than a month and then disappear for half a year, it's equivalent to abandoning all previous efforts, with no accumulation.

In recent years, many of my high school students have achieved extremely high scores in the TOEFL exam - many of them are above 110. According to [ETS's official data](ftp://ftp.ets.org/pub/toefl/ngt_percentile_information.pdf), the percentile rank of 110 points is 96.8%, that is, in each exam, approximately only 3.2% of people score above 110. From my experience, the number of university students who score above 110 on the TOEFL seems to be much less than high school students. To some extent, I can only use my own experience to examine this phenomenon. The question I ask myself is, why is it that I teach the same things, but high school students can achieve higher scores than university students?

After much thought, the most reasonable explanation might be this: high school students spend more time studying. High school students are still very accustomed to having four classes in the morning, four in the afternoon, and then doing two hours of homework at night. On the contrary, this is not the case for college students. Many college students feel that they have worked very hard if they study for two and a half hours a day! College students have too many things they can do - they need to attend friends' birthday parties, date, participate in various activities, and so on - they are too "busy", as Li Zongsheng describes, "Busy, busy, busy, is it for their own ideals or not to disappoint others?" In a sense, the fact that high school students can achieve higher TOEFL scores than college students - this phenomenon itself proves that the TOEFL exam does not test IQ, and certainly not wisdom (life experience is of no use here). Ultimately, in such an exam, the more time one spends, the more advantages one may have.

As mentioned before, if you want to change your life, you need to change your concept. From now on, please remember firmly, "quick success is impossible". If you really believe in this simple truth, it is unlikely that you will slack off, because believing in this truth is equivalent to believing in "everything depends on accumulation", and how can people who believe in this simple truth be lazy, how can they slack off?

And the real key is that, English is really one of the simplest skills - because it really doesn't need 10 years. The actual situation is, as long as you persist for 6 months, you will definitely get better. Over the years, countless high school students I have taught have clearly proven this point - and in the text behind, I have further explanations.

## 2. English Cannot Be Learned Without Being Used

The key reason why most Chinese students struggle with English is that they "study too long and use too little." For most ordinary people, English is just a tool, or to put it more complexly, a skill. If we are stricter, for most ordinary people, English can only be a tool, at most a skill. After all, only a few people will become linguists or writers (using a second language) - because many people dream of becoming linguists but most end up without any disease, just like many people who dream of becoming painters eventually become painters.

People often assume that so-called skills must be proficient to a certain extent before they can be safely applied. This assumption is indeed correct in many cases. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you must pass the exam to obtain a medical qualification before you are allowed to save the dead and help the wounded; if you want to be a lawyer, you must also pass the exam to obtain a lawyer qualification before you can uphold justice. Even simpler skills may be the same, for example, if you buy a car and want to use it as a means of transportation, you must pass the exam to obtain a driver's license before you are allowed to drive on the road - driving without a license is illegal.

However, this assumption does not apply to the acquisition and application of English (or other second languages) skills. The important reason why drivers, doctors, and lawyers need to pass exams to apply the required skills is that if these skills are applied and errors occur, they are likely to cause harm to others - even irreparable. But, the application of English skills in most cases is unlikely to harm others. If your English pronunciation is hard to hear, the listener will not faint because of it; if your English grammar errors are too many, the reader will not feel pain because of it; if others speak English to you and you don't understand, or show you English and you don't read it, unless it is an extreme situation, you will not really lose face from then on.

The skill of English is not something that must be mastered to a certain degree before it can be used. In fact, it can and should be used right from the start. But we didn't. For many Chinese students, after all these years of learning English, it's not that they've never used it. It's just that they've used it on something quite absurd and far removed from the real application of language - exams. There has never been a truly "fair, reasonable, accurate" exam in the world. All exams have a certain degree of absurdity. And this is even more true for domestic English exams - this fact is almost axiomatic, everyone knows it, and there is no need for further proof.

The acquisition of a second language is very different from the acquisition of a mother tongue. In the process of acquiring a mother tongue, we first learn to "listen", then to "speak", and only start to "read" when we are proficient in listening and speaking. "Writing" is the last skill acquired. Because "writing" fundamentally requires the most thinking ability (another thing that is even harder to learn to use), in fact, many people (perhaps a surprisingly high proportion) never really learn to "write" until they die - they can at most "recognize words". In the process of acquiring a second language, not only is this natural order disrupted, but for many people, none of the skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing have ever been truly acquired.

For a second language, most people will naturally first learn to "read", then to "listen", and then it is difficult to "speak". As for "writing", if you don't understand your mother tongue, don't mention a second language. However, in fact, "reading" is already the most important function of language as a tool (about the overemphasis on the importance of spoken language, why the practice of mocking "dumb English" is somewhat absurd, I will write another article), in the second language, "recognizing words" itself is enough, "eloquence" is certainly good, but it is also "icing on the cake" - even without flowers, it is already quite beautiful. We often say that a lot of opportunities essentially come from information asymmetry - "you know what I don't know, so I have to pay you for information." So, if you can get more information in English, isn't it already a great deal? (Do you still remember what I said before, "Actually, even dumb English is not that bad"?)

## 3. Memorizing Words is Not Learning English

Accidentally equating "memorizing words" with learning English is a common misconception among Chinese students. Memorizing words is not the same as learning English; it should only be a small part of English learning. In China, almost every student has bought several vocabulary books. I often see high school vocabulary books, CET-4 vocabulary books, CET-6 vocabulary books, postgraduate entrance examination vocabulary books, TOEFL vocabulary books, SAT vocabulary books, GRE vocabulary books... on students' bookshelves. Sometimes I can't help but ask, "Huh? Why don't you buy a good dictionary?" The answer I get is surprisingly, "Oh, it's too expensive..." It's hard to understand what these students are thinking.

Actually, it's not that hard to guess. When a student can't understand an English article, the most direct embarrassment they can feel comes from the "large number of new words" that leave them powerless. So they naturally think that their biggest problem is "not having enough vocabulary", and they hope to quickly increase their vocabulary by memorizing a vocabulary book (please note the recurring mentality of being eager for quick success). But is the problem really as it seems?

If we liken each word to a brick, and an article to a house, then it's easy to understand that an article is not just made up of vocabulary - besides bricks, there are many other materials, the most obvious of which are steel and cement. It's not that if you have more bricks than others, it means you can definitely build a bigger house than others; if you only have bricks and no steel and cement, all you have is a pile of bricks. In fact, we would all rather have fewer bricks, but we must have enough steel and cement - then we can build a house. Even if the house is a little smaller because there aren't that many bricks, at least there's a house to live in, which is much better than a pile of bricks that's neither good-looking nor useful, right? I really like this analogy, it makes things very clear:

> An essay is written with words just as a house is built with bricks, but merely a collection of words cannot be called an essay any more than a pile of bricks can be called a house.

Before determining which method of memorizing vocabulary is the best (which will be discussed in detail later), it's important to understand that merely memorizing words is definitely not enough, and may even be completely useless - having only bricks without materials like steel and cement is worse than having nothing at all, because you can't build a house and it's frustrating.

In fact, various "miracle techniques" for memorizing vocabulary are almost useless. The best and most effective method is the simplest: accumulate vocabulary through extensive reading, and digest vocabulary through frequent use - this is the only way.

## 4. To learn a foreign language well, you must not neglect your mother tongue

First, please do a TOEFL vocabulary question, and then we'll talk about the principles.

> The second possible benefit of communal roots is that they act as "information centers." During the day, parties of birds will have spread out to forage over a very large area. When they return in the evening some will have fed well, but others may have found little to eat.

> The word "forage" is closest in meaning to which of following?

    (A) fly
    (B) assemble
    (C) feed
    (D) rest

A person's foreign language ability is often limited by their own native language ability. No matter how well a second language is learned, it is difficult to surpass the native language. Even those "natural" multilingual users will inevitably encounter a situation where one language is used more than other languages in the course of life; thus, the language that is used the most will eventually become their "dominant language". And afterwards, when these people go to learn other languages, the level they can achieve will basically be limited by the level of their "dominant language". In fact, more accurately speaking, the reason why the native language usage ability is always at the highest level among the many languages a person can use is essentially because the native language has the most opportunities to be used, in driver's terms, the native language has the "longest driving age". Language, like any other skill, the more you use it, the more familiar you become, and familiarity breeds skill, and skill can create masterpieces.

Even all aspects of language application (listening, speaking, reading, writing) are the same. My personal experience is a good example. I am Korean. Before the second grade of elementary school, I attended a school that taught entirely in Korean. At that time, although I could speak both Chinese and Korean, Korean reading and writing were obviously stronger than Chinese reading and writing, and it was difficult to see much difference in listening and speaking abilities in both languages. Later, I transferred to a school that taught entirely in Chinese, and soon the situation reversed, with Chinese reading and writing skills far surpassing Korean reading and writing skills. The reason is simple, the things read and written in Chinese far exceed those read and written in Korean. In less than two years in an all-Chinese teaching environment, due to a long time without speaking Korean, I even had a fairly long period of Korean "language loss" phenomenon - although I could still understand Korean, but I just couldn't speak it (this phenomenon is often very common in bilingual areas). It wasn't until junior high school when my whole family moved to Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture due to my parents' job transfer that I slowly began to recover after a few months of having to speak Korean more often, until I could speak Korean as fluently as before. Many years later, after teaching at New Oriental for seven years, due to the needs of work, I was reading English materials for a long time almost every day. After three to five years, I could clearly feel that my English reading ability was slowly surpassing my Chinese reading ability, but my speaking and writing abilities were still far inferior to Chinese, and the reason was also very clear, that is, the usage of each aspect was different. In the few years before I left New Oriental, I was teaching composition, and while I was lecturing every day, I was also writing, and my English writing ability gradually surpassed my Chinese writing ability. And in recent years, I have been writing blogs every day, and I can clearly feel that my Chinese writing ability is constantly improving (the feeling of improving every day is often not complacency but self-deprecation - because improving every day may indicate another problem, that is, I was really too bad before), and once again surpasses English writing ability. Now, my English reading ability is the best, Chinese listening, speaking and writing abilities are second, and Korean listening, speaking, reading and writing are relatively the worst - the worst is Korean writing ability, I haven't written anything in Korean for almost twenty years ... How obvious a person's language usage ability "use and discard" is, can be glimpsed from my personal experience.

However, for most people —— who initially are monolingual users —— their proficiency and frequency of use in their mother tongue is the highest, regardless of whether it's listening, speaking, reading, or writing. When we use language to acquire knowledge, exchange experiences, and communicate discussions, we also use many other abilities in conjunction with language, such as observation, summarization, retelling, logical thinking, language organization, perspective-taking, and even the use of body language. These abilities naturally intertwine with language and text usage to fulfill their functions. When we use our mother tongue, these abilities that must be used in conjunction are naturally invoked, and their respective application skills are honed and even sublimated through continuous practice. At the same time, the improvement of these abilities will in turn affect the improvement of the language and text usage ability of the mother tongue, complementing each other.

When learning a foreign language, it is often observed that two different people, even if their IQs are roughly the same, seem to have spent the same amount of time and effort but the results are vastly different. The most reasonable explanation is that there is a huge difference between the other abilities mentioned above that the two people possess, and these abilities will limit the acquisition and exertion of language ability.

Many Chinese students are obsessed with memorizing words (in fact, memorizing words is the simplest thing in the process of learning English —— although most people don't think so), but many of them don't know that one of the important reasons why they find it so hard to memorize words is that their vocabulary in their mother tongue is not large enough. Depending on the amount of reading and the accumulation of active reading experience, everyone's vocabulary, and the vocabulary that everyone can use proficiently and clearly distinguish, are all different, often with huge differences. In this way, compared to those who have a large vocabulary in their mother tongue (the vocabulary that can be used proficiently and clearly distinguished is also relatively larger), they may encounter more words in reading that they have never used or even seen in their mother tongue, so they are relatively likely to encounter more "almost insurmountable" reading obstacles; and when reciting word lists, they also face more difficulties.

In my long-term experience of teaching TOEFL writing, the most common phenomenon I observe is that many students can't write an essay not because of their English proficiency. In fact, those essay topics, although seemingly simple, might be challenging for them to write even in Chinese. More often than not, it's not that they can't write in English, but rather they simply have nothing to write about, even if they were to use Chinese. Foreign articles are not worth reading because of their fancy diction or complex sentence structures (every culture, including the Chinese world, dislikes the "all flash and no substance" style of writing), but because good articles are concise, effective, plain, specific, and vivid. Think about it, isn't such a style of writing also considered the best in the Chinese world? At least Mr. Sun Li thinks so. How can one teach a person who usually writes empty talk in Chinese articles to write an essay in English that "uses clearly appropriate examples or details to demonstrate his ideas"? (This is one of the most important scoring criteria in the writing section of all study abroad exams—TOEFL, GRE, SAT, IELTS...)

This is not even a problem with Chinese, but a problem with thinking habits. I often tease many students when they write essays, they can only "for one zample" when they say "for example" (a pun on "for example"), and many times they don't even have one - this is caused by the habit of not observing and recording problems in daily life, and it has nothing to do with language (whether it's Chinese or English).

Most people do not have a habit of writing. As a result, many people have no experience in choosing their words carefully. However, it's easy to imagine that a person who often deliberates over their word choice in their native language would be more sensitive to the subtle differences between synonyms than those without such experience. Therefore, these people might naturally pay more attention to the subtle differences between synonyms when learning a foreign language, and they could master it more easily.

Similarly, people without a lot of reading aloud experience (many people rarely read aloud even in their native language) often lack a proper sensitivity to the rhythm of language. It's hard to imagine that they could suddenly start paying special attention to the rhythm of text when learning a foreign language. But those who are sensitive to the rhythm of their native language text, when learning a foreign language, have a relatively better chance of acquiring a more authentic, natural, and rhythmic language and text usage.

Most people, in fact, lack sufficient paraphrasing ability (which the new TOEFL test emphasizes in its evaluation), so only a few people around us can vividly recount a book they've read or a movie they've watched to others, thereby arousing others' desire to see it for themselves. I guess, probably only these few people, if they spend time and effort to learn a foreign language, can eventually do the same thing in English and achieve the same effect.

People who do not pay attention to the context when reading in their native language often have even less time to consider the context when reading in a foreign language (because there are many new words to deal with, many unfamiliar grammatical structures to parse), to the point where they often "read but do not understand".

The focus of the vocabulary question just now was "forage". In most vocabulary books on the market, this word is often taken as the first meaning in the dictionary, "noun, fodder, hay". However, all four options under this question are verbs, so "forage" in the article can only be a verb. What does it mean? (Many people are ruined by "vocabulary books" in this way.) Those who have memorized this word may tentatively guess that "fodder" is used as a noun, so it should mean "feed". Congratulations! You got it right!

But how many people can get this question right? Just look at the numbers. In the end, only 35% of people got this question right. If you subtract the number of people who guessed correctly by chance, it means that only 26.25% (=35% X 75%) of people got it right on their own strength. But in fact, "forage" is not what is called "high-difficulty vocabulary", it is in the College English Level 4 vocabulary outline, and this word is in the "F" list of every Level 4 vocabulary book. In other words, the number of TOEFL test takers who have memorized this word should far exceed the 26.25% ratio.

However, even if you don't know the word "forage", can you get this question right? Let's look at the context. The previous sentence says, "During the day, the birds go out to do something (as for what they did, I don't know for now)" (During the day, parties of birds will have spread out to forage over a very large area.), the next sentence says "When they come back in the evening, some of them have eaten their fill." (When they return in the evening some will have fed well) Now, please listen to the question - "What did they do?" Do you need to know that word? It's not even a brain teaser, the answer is "they went to eat"! Most test takers (at least more than 70%) can't imagine how considerate the questioner is: the questioner is worried that the test taker won't recognize that "fed" is the irregular past participle of "feed", and even deliberately adds another sentence at the end - "and some of the other birds hardly ate anything" (but others may have found little to eat.), to explain that "fed" is actually "eat"! So, the question asks the test taker to find a synonym for "fed" and "eat" in the four options, which is "C" option, "feed" - why would anyone get this question wrong? Strange.

After the explanation, readers can understand how absurd it is that more than 70% of people got this question wrong, right? But the statistics tell us that this is the cold, hard truth - more than 70% of people completely lack the ability to connect context.

More than 70%. If you think this ratio is astonishing, believe me, 1) you are not alone; 2) you are wrong again. Let's take a look at our own performance in the world of our mother tongue.

> "Isn't it a pleasure to study and practice what you have learned? Isn't it also great when friends visit from distant places? If people do not know me but it does not bother me, am I not a noble man?"

> —— "The Analects of Confucius" (Chapter 1: Learning)

How should these three sentences be understood? The current explanation in middle school textbooks basically follows the interpretation of Zhu Xi (1130—1202), a scholar from the Song Dynasty. The translation of these three sentences is roughly:

> Confucius said: "Isn't it very pleasant to learn and then regularly review and practice what you have learned? Isn't it very delightful when people with the same aspirations come from afar? Even if people don't understand me, I don't resent or get angry, isn't that a virtuous gentleman?"

Mr. Qian Mu (1895—1990) in his "New Interpretation of The Analects" still follows Zhu Xi's interpretation of these sentences, there is no novelty, it is just a "new translation".

> The master said: "Isn't it delightful to learn and constantly review and practice it? Isn't it joyful when many friends come from afar? If people don't know me, my heart doesn't hold a bit of resentment or unhappiness, isn't it just a well-cultivated and virtuous gentleman?"

For more than two thousand years (even until today), this interpretation has always dominated. But Mr. Nan Huaijin (born 1918) raised objections in his "Different Interpretation of The Analects" (maybe he was not the first). Regarding Mr. Nan Huaijin's specific explanation (Mr. Nan Huaijin's explanation of these three sentences exceeds three thousand words), I personally disagree with some details. For example, I don't think the word "friend" in "friends" is a borrowed word used to represent "have". "Friends" is a word that means "people who share the same aspirations" or "people who can understand you in a certain matter". However, how could everyone understand a passage written more than two thousand years ago in exactly the same way?

But the key lies in the fact that Mr. Nan Huaijin believes that these three sentences should not be isolated, but should be interconnected; while Mr. Zhu Xi and Mr. Qian Mu completely ignored the connection between these three sentences, allowing these three sentences to be interpreted in a scattered manner. Just from this point of view, Mr. Nan Huaijin has better reading comprehension skills than Mr. Zhu Xi and Mr. Qian Mu. The key to understanding text is to explore the connection between texts. If the texts are not related to each other, it is difficult for any real meaning to exist. Therefore, I believe that Mr. Nan Huaijin's explanation is better than that of Zhu Xi or Qian Mu.

It must be admitted that there are indeed not many people who can read and understand text like Mr. Nan Huaijin. But in a sense, this is something that should not have happened. Shouldn't it be natural to connect the context when reading? Of course it should. Is this a difficult thing? Of course not. So why do so few people do it? It is estimated that it is just because most people did not develop good habits at the beginning. Is it difficult to correct? From my experience, it's simple - and it has nothing to do with IQ.

Our thinking ability is limited by our own experiences, and at the same time, our future experiences depend on our thinking ability today in some sense. Therefore, we often inadvertently fall into a vicious circle. To put it bluntly, the so-called "tragic fate" of most people is actually caused in this way. For example, people who grow up in a harsh living environment are more likely to develop a negative outlook on life due to their gloomy and bumpy experiences, believe in social Darwinist creeds such as "people die for money, birds die for food", never trust anyone, and always do things by any means necessary; and this outlook on life will in turn affect every decision they make in life, ultimately destined to encounter a more dim ending. People who pursue quick success are also like this in a sense. Past life experiences have never given them the opportunity to appreciate the benefits of accumulation. So they don't have the motivation and desire to accumulate at all. In their view, "quick success" and "shortcut" are the right way. And precisely because of their thinking, their results often end up feeling empty. But time has passed, and there is less time to achieve their wishes, so they hope to find shortcuts and achieve quick success.

By the same token, our ability to learn foreign languages is limited by our experience in learning our mother tongue. The better we master our native language, the better we can learn and use foreign languages. Therefore, I often advise my students to set aside a certain amount of time each day (for example, one or two hours) to read good Chinese articles. Like those students in the Chinese department, they often need to pick out one or two brilliant sentences from the article, ponder the author's intention, purpose, word choice skills, and even the grasp of rhythm, and then read them repeatedly. This subtly improves their ability to use their native language and text. In a sense, a person's thinking ability is largely limited by his understanding and application of language and text. Some scholars have even asserted that a person's reading habits in his youth will accompany him throughout his life - this view is not extreme, in a sense, we can see every day that many people's lives are now destined when they were very young, but they themselves do not know it. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately increase one's reading difficulty. In this sense, reading "Reading" magazine is more cost-effective than reading "Reader" magazine, and even reading "Reader" magazine is much better than only reading romance martial arts novels or magazines like "Confidante". Of course, the above views are only meaningful for people who care about their thinking ability. Many people who only care about the current reading pleasure and do not care about their future benefits (this may also be a life strategy) can ignore the above suggestions and do as they please.

Li Ao has never left Taiwan since he was born, even though his spoken language pronunciation is very poor, but the articles he wrote in English are very beautiful. Lin Yutang's English articles are far more profound and elegant than Chinese articles. Qian Zhongshu's English can make many professors at Oxford and Cambridge feel inferior. In a sense, I think these masters are likely not to have superhuman intelligence to achieve such amazing results. It is more likely because they themselves use their mother tongue much better than others. They themselves are language masters, so they have extraordinary feelings, cognition, sensitivity, and insights into all aspects of language and text. Therefore, even if they spend the same time and energy as ordinary people to study foreign languages, they will inevitably make ordinary people look up and admire. What's more, these people spent more time and energy than ordinary people when they learned their mother tongue, and they have more experience and skills. Therefore, the time and energy they need to spend in learning foreign languages naturally less than ordinary people (but their past habits will make them naturally invest more time and energy than ordinary people); at the same time, they will make those experience and skills more superb through the use of (in the learning of mother tongue) already acquired experience and skills, so their foreign language level naturally makes ordinary people can only look up to their back and never get.

People tend to overestimate themselves, especially when it comes to their proficiency in their native language. Most adults are overly confident about their language skills, forgetting a simple fact: their proficiency might only be at a level that is just passable for native speakers. After graduating from school (or high school, considering our educational system), most adults are no longer forced to take language exams. They no longer have the chance to feel inferior due to poor exam results, and naturally, they believe their language skills are "quite high" - "better than a middle school student, right?" They think so, but the reality may not necessarily agree. Many undergraduates (even including a considerable number of postgraduates and PhDs) enter society and find themselves unable to draft a decent rental contract or fully understand the employment agreement they signed. Many people often misinterpret what they hear or read, not out of malice, but because their level of language comprehension is so poor that they often "don't hear" or "don't see" some important content. Imagine this, the vast majority of people (this ratio will definitely exceed 99%) no matter how seriously they write an article, no matter how many times they revise it, the possibility of "not needing to change a word" before it can be officially published is almost zero. There are likely to be some unintentional typos, hidden or obvious grammatical errors, presumptuous expressions, etc., which often require another person to scrutinize repeatedly. Many people neglect the cultivation of their mother tongue and dive headfirst into learning English like an ostrich burying its head in the sand when faced with danger. This is not necessarily intentional; the deeper reason is probably just a misjudgment of their own language proficiency.

In this light, learning a language seems much harder than physical fitness. Most people, if they can persist for three years, exercising at least two hours in the gym three days a week, can sculpt an impressive physique, men becoming robust, women slender. Of course, only one in ten thousand can achieve this (supplementary data according to). However, language learning requires the support of many knowledge skills, and these knowledge skills also require a lot of time and energy to acquire and polish. The accumulation of these other knowledge skills, in turn, will promote language acquisition and improve language application skills, complementing each other. It shows how difficult it is to learn a language - that is to say, the desire to master it without understanding is just a naive illusion.

Once when I was in Tianjin, I met a taxi driver. After he found out I was an English teacher, he said, "Do English teachers make a lot of money now?" I replied, "It's really average..." I wasn't lying, in this country, you can't make a lot of money by teaching, but the money you earn is relatively clean. He continued, "Look at us drivers, sigh, we're pitiful... No choice, we didn't understand when we were in school... Hey, you say, from now on, I'll let my son learn English, not learn anything else, just English, wouldn't he definitely learn better than others?" This driver was obviously not joking, and I wanted to answer him seriously, but I knew I couldn't explain it to him in a short time, so I had to say, "Probably..." I knew if he really let his son do that, first, his son, even if he really obeyed, couldn't do it; second, even if he really did it, it wouldn't have a good result; and I knew my perfunctory answer wouldn't harm anyone, because third, his son wouldn't listen to him at all - who would want to do such a boring thing?

In a certain sense, I always feel that if a person can learn a foreign language well, it is more thanks to his primary school language teacher than all his later English teachers. (Of course, more people's mother tongue language teachers are actually themselves - because they really haven't encountered good teachers...)

## 5. Ten-Minute Refresher Course in Language Arts

This is an exceptionally paradoxical thing: the education system under any regime is powerless in the aspect of "writing" - language education is so weak that educators in various countries are dismayed to find that at least half of the younger generation do not even possess basic "reading ability" after receiving so-called "higher education". This is a "ten-minute tutorial" - let's take a refresher course in language arts. Everyone can write, everyone has something to say, everyone should be able to write good articles; in this era when it is unprecedentedly easy to publish text, words have more power.

### First Minute: Vocabulary

It's best to reacquaint yourself with vocabulary from a different perspective. What is a noun for? A noun is used to record the things you can perceive - whether they are abstract or concrete. What is an adjective for? You use adjectives to record your perception of the thing you can perceive. What about verbs? Verbs are used to record the actions emitted by the thing you can perceive. So finally, what about adverbs? When an adverb modifies a verb, it is used to record your perception of the action emitted by the thing you can perceive; when an adverb modifies an adjective, it is used to record your perception of your perception of the thing you can perceive. (The content of this minute seems a bit convoluted, as long as you can accurately punctuate these words and understand them correctly, then just one minute later you will have undergone a transformation - your perception of words will be completely different.

### Second Minute: Grammar

You don't necessarily have to become a grammarian, but you should at least know the basic rules. This is similar to how you don't have to become Lynch or Buffett to invest in the stock market, or become Tsui Hark or Spielberg to enjoy movies; but you must learn the most basic game rules. Whether it's Chinese or English, one grammar book is enough. After understanding the basic rules, start writing, use the grammar book as a map, look up what you need, and after looking up many times, you will remember it all - just like you no longer need to check the map after going to a place several times. Don't believe those nonsense about "no need to learn grammar" - if others are crazy, that's their business, if you choose to be a fool and believe in a madman, that's your problem.

### Third Minute: Logic

Logic should be a hard-earned tool unique to humans among all creatures. Aristotle's syllogism is the most basic thing. However, when using logic in life, what we have to face is "uncertainty" and "complexity". A necessarily valid syllogism - for example, major premise: all people are mortal; minor premise: Socrates is a person; conclusion: Socrates will inevitably die - often has no practical significance. What we have to deal with in life is more likely to be this situation: major premise: politicians are usually unreliable; minor premise: Obama is of course a politician; the conclusion is uncertain, the analysis is complex: how reliable is Obama? The challenge of pursuing logical accuracy basically comes from whether a person is brave enough to face "uncertainty" and "complexity".

### Fourth Minute: Style

Articles can generally be divided into two categories: artistic and argumentative. These two types of articles are quite different. Essentially, artistic articles may pay more attention to rhetoric, be more particular about wording, and be more ornate and imaginative. However, the fundamental purpose of argumentative articles is to be understood, to convey information, accumulate knowledge, and exchange experiences; therefore, the text of argumentative articles should ideally be "concise, plain, effective, accurate, and specific". Of course, this is not a hard and fast rule, if one has the ability to articulate clearly with ornate language, it's not unacceptable; conversely, narrating a moving story with plain language is also perfectly fine. But anyone who hopes that their thought process can be effectively expressed should always remember this ten-word standard - just ten words, but they are already enough.

### Fifth Minute: Rhetoric

The power of rhetoric is self-evident. Among all rhetorical devices, perhaps only "analogy" is indispensable. The essence of analogy is "to clarify the unfamiliar X, first find a 1) familiar to everyone 2) most similar and closest to X (at least in some aspect) A, ultimately making X self-evident to everyone". Elementary school teachers say "the structure of the Earth is similar to the structure of an egg"; middle school teachers say "the internal structure of an atom is identical to the structure of the solar system"; to those who try to oppose a certain viewpoint with one or two "counterexamples" we say "any broken clock can be right twice a day"... These are all analogies, the power of analogy lies in this: it is the bridge we as humans must cross from ignorance to knowledge. Other rhetorical devices, learn when you have time, forget it when you don't - at worst, being a bit more plain isn't a bad thing.

### Minute Six: Knowledge

Words, phrases, sentences, grammar, style, rhetoric, and so on, are all means of expression. Without rice, no matter how skillful one is, they can't cook a meal. The term "seeking knowledge" is too idealistic, it's better to use a more down-to-earth phrase: "doing homework". To do anything well, you need to do your homework in advance. Whether writing a novel or a tutorial, you need to do your homework; the more homework you do, the more you know, the more you have to think about. When these things reach a certain level, what you write will inevitably be profound and textured. The reason why shallow text is shallow is simple: the author didn't do their homework. Knowledge changes destiny, because once a person acquires new knowledge, their entire world changes as a result. Trust me, homework is endless.

### Minute Seven: Communication

Effective expression is just the most basic level, effective communication is the real goal. It's not easy to think from multiple perspectives, and it's even harder to think from the perspective of someone who opposes your viewpoint. But if you can't do this, you can't be a good listener or a good reader. Output depends on input, this is an unchanging truth; without eating grass, a cow can't produce milk. Communication is not just about persuasion, it's more about getting feedback. The most important skill in communication is this: don't think that you and your viewpoint are the same thing. If you can do this, it's easy to see the value in various feedback. For those who can't do this, not only is good advice hard to hear, but there's nothing pleasing to the ear or eye - pitiful, tragic.

### Eighth Minute: Practice

Experience needs to be accumulated, and accumulation can only come through practice. The so-called "divine inspiration at the stroke of a pen" is a naive fantasy that only those who can't write might believe. Good articles are never created in one go; they are always revised into existence. The so-called "inspiration" is more likely to flash in practice, rather than appear out of thin air. Writing for an author is like driving for a driver. A driver needs to accumulate a certain mileage to encounter all possible safety issues, and eventually, one day, their experience will be sufficient to avoid all dangers. The same goes for authors. Only after writing to a certain extent can they understand the various properties of words - it's unlikely that they can understand all the properties of words through a single writing tutorial. Not only should you write more, but you should also do more homework to write well. This is the starting point of a virtuous cycle.

### Ninth Minute: Skill

Skills are something that you will only learn easily when you understand where they can be applied. In this current "ten-minute tutorial", each of the ten aspects mentioned requires skills. Through a certain amount of practice, anyone will naturally master some skills. But there is one skill that should be polished first - the skill of acquiring knowledge: from observation to listening, from reading to ruminating, from reading books to taking notes, from using the library to using search engines, all means of acquiring knowledge require skills, and these basic skills need to be constantly polished. Next is the skill of logical thinking, followed by the skill of communication. These three should be prioritized over other skills because polishing any skill requires time, and when time is limited, priorities must be set.

### Tenth Minute: Rectification

No one can achieve perfection from the start. Just as a good article is repeatedly revised to become a good article, an author also needs to repeatedly rectify themselves to become a good author. Almost everything needs rectification, and it needs repeated rectification - as long as time permits. The previous minute said that every skill needs to be polished, this minute says that even skills need to be repeatedly rectified. Sometimes, everything needs to be completely overturned and started again, which requires not only courage but also patience and wisdom. Keep your mind open, the reason why it is easy to know and hard to do is because it contains pain - the pain of breaking teeth and swallowing blood (Zeng Guofan's words).

## 6. How to Learn English by Watching Movies?

"Learning English by watching movies" was once a method I quite despised. I have always had a small prejudice: all flashy things are undesirable. In fact, to this day, I don't think "learning English by watching movies" is any shortcut. However, whether among students or readers, it seems that many people really want to "learn English by watching movies" - their basis is nothing more than "you have to be interested" - in fact, interest is not that important.

In 2008, I gave a lecture at Tang Zhong in Yinchuan. After the meeting, I chatted with a little girl. She mentioned that she did well in some subjects because she was interested, and some other subjects were not ideal because she was not interested. I thought about it and told her, "Who can't learn and do well in what they are interested in? The real awesome thing is 'even if you are not interested, as long as you should learn, you can learn, and then use it well'...". As time goes by, that girl should have taken the college entrance examination, right? I wonder if she really understood it at the time?

However, as a teacher, there are many times when you shouldn't be too concerned about whether the student's starting point is correct or appropriate. Regardless of the reason, wanting to learn is already quite commendable. Therefore, without further ado, we should provide some effective suggestions to those students who want to "learn English by watching movies".

After downloading the movies you want to see and enjoy, the first step is to search for English subtitles on Google. The search keywords can generally be formatted as follows:

> "Movie name Release year English subtitle"

For example, if you want to find the English subtitles for "12 Angry Men", you should search for

> 12 Angry Men 1957 English subtitle

As long as the movie is not too new or obscure, you can usually find English subtitles easily on Google.

There are many formats for subtitles, but it is recommended to only download "srt" format English subtitles, because this format of subtitles can be directly opened with a notepad program (this file is a text file itself).

After opening the subtitle file with Notepad, use "Ctrl+A" (Select All), then "Ctrl+C" (Copy), to copy the subtitle content into a Word document, and then, read intensively.

Look up all the words you don't recognize - also pay attention to identifying phrases - and then create a word list that belongs to you. (Refer to the previous "How to turn MS Word into a learning tool").

Then start watching the movie. Try first without any subtitles; if it's too difficult, then turn on the English subtitles. Note: Never watch with Chinese subtitles, if you don't understand English, look it up in the dictionary.

Then find time to review the word list you made before two or three times, and watch the movie again when you have time.

At this point, some readers will say, "Isn't that too troublesome? There's no fun at all..." Trust me, I'm definitely not hearing this complaint for the first time (**people who are afraid of trouble can't do anything well**). But this complaint is shortsighted — no one needs to be so meticulous for a lifetime. After three or five movies, you will find that your improvement is rapid, and most films can be understood almost completely.

Overall, the degree of English improvement by watching movies is quite limited. Whether it's movies or TV shows, after all, they tell stories more through images, and most movies have more action than dialogue. This is especially true for students who like to watch action films and gunfight films, where most of what they hear is nothing more than phrases like "Drop it!" or "Go! Go! Go!!!" Even the dialogue in art films is quite limited in terms of diction — it's never as direct or effective as "massive reading."

The difference between series and series is also very large, like 24, Lost, The Sopranos and other series, basically 2000 vocabulary is enough, some historical dramas need a slightly larger vocabulary, such as Rome, John Adams and so on. Some other series seem to be very difficult, but they are not. A typical example is House M.D. At first, you will feel that it is full of a lot of medical terms, but after one or two episodes, you will understand that there are only about a hundred words, such as MRI, spasm and so on. In the end, even if you don't understand the medical-related content, it doesn't matter, because the exciting part of the plot has nothing to do with medicine. There are also some series full of slang, such as Dead Woods, which are not very meaningful for beginners. Even if you learn such slang, there is almost no place to use it. The West Wing is about how a group of elites operate the White House, so the quality of the lines is gorgeous, the sentences are wonderful, the logic is exquisite, and the difficulty is quite high. I have privately recommended it to some students, and found that only a very small number of students are interested, most people are just "for fun", as for "learning", it is just an excuse for "fun."

## 7. Stop Being a "Beginner"!

The initial draft of this book was completed in April 2010. By the beginning of 2011, when the final draft was being revised, it had already spread widely on the internet. Many readers asked, "Who is this book aimed at?" Even the editors of this book asked similar questions, "Is it suitable for beginners with large chunks of English left untranslated?"

I can only repeat what I've said before: I hope that everyone will stop considering themselves as beginners. Mastering a foreign language is not a big deal; it just takes some effort.

In the matter of language acquisition, it can be affirmed that almost all glass ceilings are self-imposed. The harm of considering oneself a "beginner" lies in the fact that once this is accepted, all subsequent incompetence is taken for granted: "I'm a beginner, it's normal not to understand..." "I'm a beginner, it's not strange not to read..." "I'm a beginner, of course, I can't speak well..." These thoughts are so natural, so reasonable, that unconsciously, one is restrained by these thoughts, and the result is: one remains a beginner for life. As mentioned in Chapter 3, many people thought they needed to "progress step by step", so they insisted on listening to VOA SE programs. The result was dependency, willingly remaining in the realm of "only able to understand VOA".

Stop casting yourself as a "beginner", that shouldn't be you. After finishing the middle school English textbook, you are already an "English user". You can, like a native speaker, learn while using, use while learning, continue to use until you enjoy it...

> What to do when you encounter something you can't read? <br />
> **—— Look it up in the dictionary!**

> What if you looked it up and couldn't find it? <br />
> **—— Try another dictionary!**

> What if you've checked several dictionaries and still can't find it? <br />
> **—— Google it!** Put the English sentence you don't understand into Google's search box with quotation marks around it, then add a sentence in Chinese saying "What does this mean?" and hit enter... If you're reading a popular text, trust me, there must have been people who didn't understand it before you, and some of them must have asked about it online, and these questions have often been answered... (Google can answer all kinds of "strange" questions, for example, [why is "John" translated as "John"?](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E2%80%9CJohn%E2%80%9D%E4%B8%BA%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E8%A2%AB%E7%BF%BB%E8%AF%91%E6%88%90%E2%80%9C%E7%BA%A6%E7%BF%B0%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%9F&oq=%E2%80%9CJohn%E2%80%9D%E4%B8%BA%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E8%A2%AB%E7%BF%BB%E8%AF%91%E6%88%90%E2%80%9C%E7%BA%A6%E7%BF%B0%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%9F&aqs=edge..69i57.428j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)）

If you don't know how to use Google, simply type "how to use Google" into the Google search bar and hit enter. See what the search results yield...

This isn't something that requires "courage" to do; it's simply something that should be done.

In the past two or three years, the English proficiency of users in China has been undergoing a seismic shift. Although they are still a minority in terms of proportion, a considerable number of people have changed their mindset and embarked on a different path. At the end of 2010, when I gave a lecture at Shenzhen Middle School, I learned that many first and second-year high school students read more than 50 English books a year. Such a number would certainly shock many people. But in reality, this is just the normal level of language usage for a normal person. Think about it, when you were in high school, didn't you also finish a novel in an afternoon? Reading 50 books a year is just a pace of one book a week, which is not exaggerated at all. These children who read extensively, without attending any training classes, casually score above 110 on the TOEFL, and it's basically impossible to score below 2300 on the SAT. This is what's happening in China. To my knowledge, many students in famous middle schools in China are like this, such as Nanjing Foreign Language School, Changsha Yale Middle School, Northeast Yucai Middle School, Beijing No. 4 Middle School, Taiyuan No. 5 Middle School... And those whose minds have long been restricted? The majority of English majors in Chinese universities that I know of do not read more than 10 English books a year. This is the difference, this is the result of a difference in mindset.

Stop fooling yourself with terms like "beginner" or "hobbyist"!
