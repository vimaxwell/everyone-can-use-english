# Chapter 1: The Starting Point

## 1. Can we possibly use a foreign language better than our mother tongue?

Yes.

In the past, I didn't believe it, just like you. But now, I do believe it because over the years, I have taught many students who have achieved this. I have witnessed too many such "miracles" that are commonplace in the eyes of others.

All multilingual users are the same. Ultimately, among the multiple languages they use, there is always a "dominant language". Which one is the dominant language does not depend on which one is the mother tongue, but on which language is used the most.

I have been a bilingual user since I was a child - because I am Korean. Korean and Chinese are both my mother tongues, and I have been fluent in both since I was a child. However, as time went by, because the frequency of using Chinese in life far exceeded that of Korean, in the end, Chinese became my dominant language - just because I used it the most.

In the past five years, I have brought out many high school students. They started preparing for studying abroad from the first year of high school (some a little later). While ensuring their schoolwork, they need to make extra efforts to get high scores in TOEFL, get high scores in SAT, so that they can go to prestigious universities in the United States in the fall of the third year of high school. The earliest group of high school students I came into contact with have now graduated from undergraduate studies, and most of them are pursuing doctoral degrees in Ivy League schools...

For these people, from a practical point of view, their dominant language may no longer be their mother tongue, but English. Because in the stage of their rapid growth and the most concentrated and rich acquisition of knowledge and information, they use almost all English. In fact, in the three years before they left China, their English level had far exceeded the imagination of others - many students scored more than 2300 points in the SAT: such scores, even among Americans, are one in a hundred. After arriving in the United States, just looking at their reading volume, it can only be getting bigger and not smaller, and the frequency of their use of English and Chinese, especially in listening and speaking, has long been separated. (Note, after 2016, the total score of SAT was changed to 1600.)

Even some of them (not necessarily a minority), from the moment they entered a prestigious American school, began to learn another foreign language, such as French, Spanish, German, etc.; and two or three years later, they can already use the "third language" proficiently in listening, speaking, reading and writing...

When I hold lectures at domestic universities, I often mention these students, and many students who are struggling for the CET-4 and CET-6 often express their doubts to me: "Cut, who believes it?", "How is it possible!" I understand. For them, this kind of thing is absolutely impossible - although, that's just what they think is impossible.

"Can we use a foreign language better than our mother tongue?"

The answer to this question is "yes".

And this answer of only one word is very important.

Although not everyone can do it, but, "can" or at least "possible" this fact, will change everything, at least can change everything for some people. It's like there's always a small part of people who really understand: no matter how big the difference between 1 and 99 is, it's not as big as the difference between 0 and 1.

Knowing the answer to this word is likely to be the starting point for some people to be reborn.

## 2. But why can't most people learn well?

"I've been studying for so many years, why am I getting worse and worse..."

This was my confusion. Over the years, I have given lectures and taught classes all over the place, and I have also learned that many, many people have more or less the same feelings - I am not alone.

Why are we getting worse and worse?

Because we never believed that we could learn and do well!

What is even more chilling after thinking about it is: we may not even know that "we have never believed".

In our bones, the vast majority of us never believe that we can learn a foreign language well - let alone multiple languages. Those who are proficient in multiple languages are gifted in our eyes, "different from us ordinary people".

Although we have been "working hard" to learn English for many years in the past (six years of elementary school, six years of middle school, four years of undergraduate...), the actual effect is very small. Once willing to face it squarely, every person who has "worked hard to learn English" for ten years and has not achieved it will admit: in these years, the actual learning time is very little.

On the one hand, we do know that English is very useful so it is best to learn it, on the other hand, because we do not believe in our bones that we can actually learn it, we do not actually work hard, and on the other hand, these two diametrically opposed views cause learners to be anxious and helpless.

What is it that makes us "never believe"? What is it that makes us "never believe" and yet not know it?

There may be many reasons. But our high school English textbooks are definitely the culprit (at least one of them). In our country, the vocabulary outline for the college entrance examination is basically composed of about 3500 words. Due to different regions and different textbooks, let's calculate a little more, let's calculate it as 3600. Although we don't know what impact this number will have on us, the indisputable fact is that we do know this number - at least we know it roughly.

Before graduating from high school, we have studied English for at least 6 years - elementary school and kindergarten are not counted. So what does this mean? The number 3600 tells us that we can learn 600 English words a year - if we really do it, then in the English test of the college entrance examination, the score will definitely be among the best... There are 365 days a year, so how many words do we need to learn a day? Less than 2 is enough...

The number of English words in the vocabulary outline for the college entrance examination silently conveys such a message to every child:
1. English is very difficult, very difficult...
2. You are very stupid, very stupid...
3. It's amazing to be able to learn two words a day!

Yeah. That's it.

In the spring of 2010, I completed the first draft of this book. At that time, I still felt it was difficult to explain this truth clearly and clearly to readers. Fortunately, in the fall of 2010, Hollywood director Christopher Nolan made a blockbuster that was praised all over the world - "Inception" (translated as "Dream Space"). This title (literally translated as "implantation") has become a well-known concept. This helped me a lot! Nolan explained to the audience in the movie: an idea must be simple enough to be implanted; the simpler the idea, the more deeply rooted it is after being implanted; because the person who has this idea cannot tell whether this idea is his own or implanted... The same is true, the vocabulary outline for the college entrance examination is in this way, quietly "implanting" that extremely simple idea into our brains, and then making it deeply rooted and affecting our lives...

Many times, **people are stupid because they are taught**. Education has always played a role in failure - so success is bound to be accidental. The weird thing about education is that if you educate students as geniuses, students are almost destined not to become geniuses, because geniuses are self-taught; but if you educate students as idiots, then students will definitely become idiots - because people are stupid because they are taught.

Fortunately, everyone has the right to self-study, and in fact, no matter who it is, they have more or less certain self-study ability. What's better is that some knowledge can be instantly understood and put into effect. The previous section answered this question, "Can we use a foreign language better than our mother tongue?" The answer is "yes". Knowing the meaning of this answer is that it can root out the previously implanted ideas.


## 3. Why do some people "easily" master it?

Contrary to those who "get worse the more they learn," there are some people, perhaps a minority, who easily master and excel - just like the "lucky ones" I mentioned earlier who are already studying at prestigious universities in the United States.

The question is, they were also implanted with the same idea - they also studied in high schools in China, used the same textbooks, attended the same classes, and encountered the same English teachers... So why weren't they affected?

The answer is, they were implanted with another idea, even though they might not know the truth themselves.
Most of these students grew up in urban cities in China, where there would be at least one institution providing TOEFL/SAT training.

The existence of such training institutions itself is more important than their "teaching quality". These training institutions are constantly spreading a message: there is an exam called TOEFL (in recent years they have also let more people know about another exam, called SAT), many people go to learn, many people go to take the exam, and in the end, many people get high scores (whether the people who get the message make a logical error here is not important, what is important is that even this kind of erroneous logical relationship is an important component of the powerful information that is transmitted externally)... What's even more important is that those who go to learn, take the exam, and finally get high scores are right next to them; when people see that "even those who are not as good as themselves " go to learn, take the exam, and finally get high scores, taking action is just natural.

In other words, the fact of "the existence of such training institutions" itself may be more meaningful and influential to students than "going to a certain training institution for classes". This is not my own theory, in fact, there is a special course abroad called "Power of the place" - a branch of geography, which specifically studies this mechanism and its influence.

This is the power of concept. If you don't know the existence of the TOEFL exam, you may not even have the opportunity to take the exam. If you don't think it's an exam that can get a high score, you may not even try to work hard. Just because you know its existence, you may start to work hard; just because you see that "even those who are not as good as you" (although this may simply be an illusion) get high scores, you have no reason not to work hard, and in the end, you may also get high scores...

In fact, "**I can do it too**" these three words are the most realistic and effective motivation for the vast majority of ordinary people. This is especially true in areas like learning a second language that basically do not rely on talent.

[^2]: People often misunderstand the causal relationship: they see that others go to participate in a certain training first, and then get high scores, so they think that there is a causal relationship between "that training class" and "getting high scores"; this is no different from "thinking that the rooster calls up the sun" in essence.

[^3]: People always tend to overestimate themselves. For example, an interesting survey found that more than 70% of drivers believe that their driving skills are above average. So, "even those who are not as good as themselves" is often just an illusion.


## 4. How Do Beliefs Influence Me?

The power of beliefs can be so profound that a slight shift in one's beliefs can potentially change a person's entire life.

Penetrating the surface to reach the essence is not as easy as it sounds. Historians have reached a consensus after many years of research that it was not the advanced weaponry of the Europeans that defeated the Native Americans, but the viruses that existed on the Europeans, which were invisible and intangible to both the Europeans and the Native Americans at the time. These viruses caused the Native Americans to fall ill and die in droves, making the Europeans appear to have "divine assistance"...

So, often the actual root of the problem is far removed from the seemingly obvious manifestation. The power of beliefs has also had a dramatic impact on me personally.

About twenty years ago (around 1988), when I first started high school, a professor of English in my father's research office took the TOEFL test and scored 570 points (out of a total of 677). When people talked about it, they all said, "That's a pretty good score!" (Because a professor had taken the test before and scored 530...) Although I didn't understand what kind of test it was, it left an impression on me: it was a difficult test.

A few years later, in 1993, when I was a junior in college, a classmate from the next class was said to be preparing for the TOEFL. Looking back, college students in Beijing were preparing for this test in full swing, but in Changchun at the time, no one knew about this test. There, I was considered well-informed. One night when we were talking about this in the dormitory, I told everyone how difficult the TOEFL test was. When everyone heard that a college professor had only scored 570, they stuck out their tongues and all said, "This is simply not a test for humans!" After that, we gave that classmate a nickname - "Beast".

That summer, I went to Beijing to find a high school classmate who was studying at Tsinghua University and asked him to help me assemble a 486 computer. On the way, he pointed to a bungalow and said, "That's New Oriental." He said it as if I should know. So I asked, "What's New Oriental?" He told me it was an English training institution, and if you want to go abroad, you should take a course there. It is said that college students are spreading the word: "Going there doesn't necessarily guarantee a high score, but not going there definitely means you won't get a high score." This topic quickly passed, and we continued to chat about something else, which I have long since forgotten...

Many years later, one day after I had been teaching at New Oriental for several years, I suddenly remembered that many, many years ago, when Yu Minhong was still in the start-up phase, I had actually heard of New Oriental...
And the discussion in the dormitory at that time was quickly forgotten by the students. I don't even remember the name of that classmate now. Of course, I don't know how many points he scored on the TOEFL, but I do know that he went to the United States the following year.

At the end of 2000, I had graduated from college for many years, during which time I had made a lot of money in sales and wholesale, and then spent all my savings at home taking care of my sick father. I was in desperate need of a stable job. Later, a friend from high school called me from Beijing and said, "Xiaolai, come to Beijing, teach at New Oriental, the income is good." By this time I had forgotten that I had heard about New Oriental from a classmate in Beijing six years ago, and just asked him, "Are you sure the income is not low?" The friend said, "Don't worry, with your eloquence, you'll definitely be fine!" So I took the train to Beijing, enrolled in a course at New Oriental, bought a variety of question sets at the door of New Oriental with difficulty, and then locked myself in a small one-bedroom apartment on the 11th floor of Shuangyushu, Haidian District for four months, took the TOEFL, took the GRE, and applied to New Oriental with my amazing scores. Then I taught there for seven years in one breath. During this period, New Oriental Education & Technology Group was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with the ticker symbol EDU.

In 2003, on the day "TOEFL Core Vocabulary 21 Days Breakthrough" was published and distributed, I invited guests, and a bunch of friends chatted casually. Somehow, I suddenly remembered the situation when I passed by the old site of New Oriental in Zhongguancun in 1994 (which was about ten years ago) when I was assembling a computer, and then I suddenly remembered the classmate who we had nicknamed "Beast", and I couldn't help but shiver.

Before this shiver, I always felt that it was something to brag about that I locked myself in a small room for four months at the "old age" of 28 in 2000 and got high scores on the TOEFL and GRE; but after this shiver, I suddenly realized that when I was "very naive" (1993), I could have taken the TOEFL and GRE, but at that time I thought it was "impossible"; and I even called that classmate "Beast" with the same self-righteousness as other classmates... If I had prepared for the TOEFL and GRE that year (instead of at the age of 28 - a difference of seven years!), now thinking back, if I had used my smart brain when I was still in school, maybe I wouldn't have needed four months (maybe three months?) to get a high score. If that were really the case, wouldn't my life afterwards be vastly different? Now thinking back, my mentality was simply "beastly", and I couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat as if it were pouring rain.

I often tell my students about this experience. People are like this, they hear a lot of truths and in the end they can't take them in, only real examples that they can see and touch will move them. Over the years, I know that my experience has brought enough impact to many students around me, changed some people, and changed some other things that I don't know about.


## 5. Is there a theoretical basis for such conclusions?

In the GRE exam, there is an essay topic:

> "No field of study can advance significantly unless outsiders bring their knowledge and experience to that field of study."

> Unless outsiders bring knowledge and experience from other fields, no field can make significant progress.

Although this statement is not always true, it is indeed a common phenomenon. For example, this book about second language acquisition (English learning) needs to start from elsewhere.

Two researchers from Johns Hopkins University, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, started an experiment at the end of 1959 that affected countless second language learners around the world for many years to come - although the impact was mainly negative - even though the purpose of the experiment itself did not seem to have a direct connection with foreign language learning: it was to study the early development of the animal visual system.

> They surgically sutured one eye of a cat or monkey that was a few months old; after a while, they reopened it. The research shows that even after reopening the sutured eyelid, these animals' eyes cannot regain visual function. Closing one eye for a period of time has a significant impact on the structure of the visual area in the animal's brain. However, visual deprivation for the same time or longer in adult cats will neither affect their visual ability nor affect their brain structure. Only young animals will be deprived of visual sensitivity during their "critical period" (Critical Period).

> ![](images/figure01.png)

> There are documentaries of this experiment on youtube:
> * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOHayh06LJ4
> * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE952yueVLA

This research and its results eventually won the two a Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1981, "because this research has made a huge contribution to understanding how the visual system processes information." But people seem to be more interested in the "critical period" concept proposed in this research. Scientists soon discovered that other parts of the brain also need to be stimulated to develop, and they seem to all conform to the critical period theory. According to the critical period theory, the brain is "plastic" (Plastic) only during the critical period, and the external stimuli received by the brain at this time may even change the structure of the brain; after the critical period, the brain is no longer plastic. Soon, the concept of "critical period" extended to various scientific fields.

Linguist Eric Heinz Lenneberg was born in Germany, fled to Brazil during World War II, and later immigrated to the United States. He studied at the University of Chicago and Harvard University. Later, as a professor of psychology and neurobiology, he taught at Harvard Medical School, the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, and Cornell University Medical School. Professor Lenneberg proposed the "Language Acquisition Critical Period Hypothesis" in 1967, believing that the critical period of language acquisition begins at birth and ends at some point between the age of eight and the end of adolescence. After the "critical period", the ability to acquire a second language will decline significantly, and it is impossible to remove the accent from the mother tongue.

In fact, Professor Lenneberg is quite cautious and proposes a "hypothesis" (Hypothesis). However, once almost all scientific research results enter the public communication field, they will more or less be mixed with misunderstandings, or even deliberately distorted. For example, after Martin Seligman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, proposed "Learned Optimism", it was immediately taken as a prop in their hands by the masters of success, regardless of Professor Seligman's reserved attitude and rigor. Similarly, when Professor Lenneberg's "hypothesis" came to the market, it became a "theory" (Theory). The original "beginning at birth, ending at some point between the age of eight and the end of adolescence" also became "beginning at 0 years old, ending at 10 years old" - on the other side of the ocean in China, this has almost become the main propaganda tool for all children's English projects, and the subtext of the purpose is nothing more than to scare parents to pay quickly, "otherwise it will be too late!". More commonly, this "critical period theory" has become an excuse for many people to comfort themselves. It is normal not to learn well, because "the critical period has long passed!" Or "it's not good if you don't learn when you were a child..." Or "I'm so old, there's no drama!", etc.

In fact, the real contribution of David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel is that they proved that the brain is "plastic", not unchanging. And their limitation lies in the "critical period" that people talk about. At that time, they were both staunch supporters of "regional theory"-and regional theory was not overturned by the academic community until a long time later.

![](images/figure02.png)

Regional theory (Localizationism) believes that the brain is like a complex machine, and each part of this machine has its specific function; and then, each specific function is limited by hardware (Hardwired). The implication of regional theory is that once a certain area of the brain is damaged, the function under the jurisdiction of that area cannot be recovered. And clinical observations seem to be able to confirm this conclusion: for example, the paralyzed limbs of stroke patients seem to be unable to recover no matter what.

![](images/figure03.png)

A very beautiful boy, isn't he? Have you noticed his eyes? This is not a special effect, this boy's eyes are so bright. This boy is a Sea Gypsy, their eyes are all so bright.

Sea Gypsies live near the west coast of Thailand and belong to nomadic people, but they live on seafood. Most of their lives are drifting at sea. This boy was born at sea. They can learn to swim before they learn to speak and walk. They can easily dive below 30 feet without using any equipment - a tribe called Suru often has to dive below 75 feet to pick pearls. They can control and lower their heart rate, thereby controlling their oxygen consumption, they can stay underwater for a long time, often twice as much as ordinary people.

Of course, the most surprising thing is their eyes. They can maintain good, and even better, vision underwater. This is because they have learned how to control the size of their pupils, being able to shrink their pupils by 22%. All along, people have believed that the contraction scale of the pupil is fixed (determined by human genes), and it should not be consciously controlled, subject to the "autonomic nervous system."

Scientists believe that this is not the result of a "genetic mutation," but the "plasticity" of the brain. Because scientist Anna Gislen and her colleagues brought the Sea Gypsies to Europe, they quickly taught a group of Swedish children how to constrict their pupils. Now scientists believe that the brain has strong plasticity and has always maintained this plasticity from beginning to end. All external stimuli (especially systematic training) will affect our brains, and the structure and function of the brain will change accordingly.

Ancient people observed that, "If they are not of my race, their hearts must be different." From this point of view, it is correct, because it seems that culture is constantly shaping the brains of people affected by this culture. What has always been considered a "hardware" limitation has now been clearly proven (at least in part) to be a "software" development problem. Our brain is like a magical computer - because its hardware even has the ability to "adapt" to the installed "software."

The reason why scientists infer that the "special function" of the Sea Gypsies is not the result of a "genetic mutation" is mainly based on two aspects:

1. Research shows that for tens of thousands of years, the structure of the human brain has hardly changed;
2. This ability can be learned within one generation without the need for genetic accumulation.

![](images/figure04.png)

In the past hundred years, a large number of "cave paintings" have been discovered all over the world. According to carbon isotope analysis, the oldest of these murals are works from thirty thousand years ago, and the most recent are about ten thousand years ago. These works often surprise and even frustrate modern painters. When Picasso visited the newly discovered Lascaux cave in the town of Dordogne, France in 1940, he saw these murals (one of them is shown in the picture above), and he was somewhat lost. Speaking of so-called modern art, he commented, "We have actually learned nothing."

In fact, this is not bad news. On the contrary, it is the best good news. People could make such magical works tens of thousands of years ago, indicating that the human brain at that time had sufficient potential, and our development and progress today, in a sense, is the result of developing this potential.

Anna Gislen taught a group of European children to constrict their pupils like the Sea Gypsies in just eight months, proving that this ability is not inherited. Perhaps most people can't see the specific practical significance of this proof, but for second language learners, this is undoubtedly a significant discovery. For a long time, there has been a debate in the scientific community: "Is language ability innate?"

In fact, there is no need to argue. Obviously, language ability is not innate, but acquired. In fact, the emergence of language and text has only been a few thousand years so far, and the human brain before that was not incapable of processing language and text, but there was no language and text available for processing. In fact, scientists have long discovered that they can teach people in primitive tribes to use "new" languages and texts within a generation. The same is true for our country's literacy work. Compared with other animals, humans have stronger language ability because the brain has a larger capacity and wider potential. Many scientists have successfully taught monkeys or other animals some human languages - it's just that their memory is too poor and their potential is limited, so they are unlikely to reach the human realm.

If it is said that, 1) the brain is plastic; 2) language ability is acquired, then theoretically, anyone can learn any language. But it doesn't seem to be the case in practice. And the "critical period" theory has cast a shadow on hope. Because according to the critical period theory, the brain is plastic only in the initial period. However, after two or three decades, scientists have finally proven:

1. The brain is plastic;
2. And it is plastic from beginning to end;
3. Even it can reorganize itself (Reorganizing), through proper training, it can use another area to acquire the ability of the damaged area...

However, this proof process is particularly difficult.
Can the reader guess from the picture below, is the little girl being treated at the [American UAB Rehabilitation Center](http://www.uabhealth.org) injured in her left arm or right arm?

![](images/figure05.png)

In fact, her left arm was not injured, and the reason why her left arm was fixed was because it was an uninjured arm, and the right arm was the injured one that needed to be recovered through training... Huh? What's going on? But from a physiological point of view, the damaged part of the brain cannot be recovered, so how can she recover the already injured right arm through training?

The magic of the brain is that it can use other undamaged parts to relearn the function of the damaged part (academically called "remap", "reroute", or "rewire"). The reason why the freely moving left arm needs to be tied up is that if it is not done, in the face of any demand, the part of the brain that controls the left arm (or called "left arm brain map") will "start first"; because this part is undamaged, and the part that originally controlled the right arm has been damaged. In other words, at this time, there is no part in the brain that can control the right arm. But after the left arm is fixed, even though the part of the brain that controls the left arm still "starts first", it can't actually manipulate the left arm freely. And in this case, you can let other parts of the brain slowly focus on the right arm, and then learn to control the right arm - that is, through such training, you can slowly make an undamaged part of the brain "learn" the function originally controlled by the damaged part. Before long, the girl's right arm recovered, and it was no different from the original when it moved. But her brain is no longer what it used to be, although a part of it is damaged and cannot be recovered, but another part of her brain has been developed and can complete the function that the damaged part could originally complete without any difference.

Just before 2004, this therapy was completely unimaginable. This initially incredible therapy is called "CI Activity Therapy" (Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy, abbreviated as "CI" or "CIMT") and its inventor is [Edward Taub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Taub) professor. Today, this therapy is gradually being popularized worldwide, helping countless hemiplegic patients to regain their original self and life. But Professor Taub's research experience has been ups and downs. In order to find a treatment plan for hemiplegia, he needs to artificially make monkeys hemiplegic (deliberately damage a part of the monkey's brain), and then try to train those monkeys to recover from hemiplegia... In the early 1980s, he was sued by an animal rights protection organization, causing the laboratory to be closed, funds to be frozen, and finally even lost his job, and almost everyone avoided him. In the next six years, all of Professor Taub's time and energy were consumed in defending himself - the huge social pressure made him unable to find a lawyer willing to defend him, so he had to be his own lawyer. Before the case, Professor Taub had a total of about 100,000 US dollars in savings. By the time he finally won the lawsuit and cleared all charges, he only had about four thousand dollars in savings. Of course, today, based on the huge value he has created for mankind with his theory and practice, Professor Taub is recognized as one of the most outstanding scientists in the world today.

The success of Professor Taub's CI therapy first proves that regionalism is wrong (at least not completely correct) - the brain can reorganize itself; secondly, it proves that the brain is plastic from beginning to end, and even can be reorganized - that is, use a new brain map to complete the function originally completed by the damaged brain map; the last and most important proof is: there is competition between brain maps - so, in order to cure the damaged right arm, you must first restrict the undamaged left arm. If the undamaged left arm is not restricted, then the brain map of the left arm will always be dominant, and then, the brain will produce "learned non-use" (Learned Nonuse) for the already damaged right arm.

This last point can be used to clearly explain the phenomenon that was wrongly explained by the "critical period theory": why is it more difficult to learn a second language after adulthood?

The reason why learning a second language seems more difficult after adulthood is not due to the "critical period" theory, which suggests that the brain is no longer plastic after this period. In fact, it is because the brain map used for the second language has to compete with the already powerful mother tongue brain map - of course, this becomes increasingly difficult. However, it is precisely this understanding that gives people hope. Currently, many educators are advocating "immersive learning", which has a certain basis and considerable effect. The so-called "immersive learning" is to force students to only use the second language and prohibit the use of the mother tongue in a specific time and environment, thereby stimulating the brain to accelerate the construction of a new brain map. The globally popular Rosetta Stone language learning software ([Rosetta Stone](https://www.rosettastone.com)) is developed based on this principle.

For second language learners, the most intuitive and meaningful good news is:
1. It's never too late to start learning;
2. As long as the method is appropriate and given time, you can definitely learn well.
3. Even, the second language may surpass the mother tongue and become the dominant language.

(Of course, in the following content, readers will know that there is a better method than "learning"......)
In learning this matter, believing that you can definitely learn well does not necessarily guarantee that you can really learn well; but on the contrary, if you believe that you cannot learn well, then you will definitely not be able to learn well in the end. The so-called "self-fulfilling prophecy" ([Self-fulfilling prophecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy)) is like this, always working negatively. In fact, the "critical period of language acquisition" has caused incalculable harm worldwide for more than forty years. Countless people have inadvertently turned "hypothesis" into "conclusion", believing that they cannot learn well, and thus become victims of "self-fulfilling prophecy".

"I have no talent", "I just can't learn well", "English is too difficult" and the like, even such thoughts, are actually powerful curses. They have both powerful and evil power. Observe the people around you, you will be surprised to find that many people who have learned English for many years, the most fluent and standard English sentence is: "I’m sorry, my English is poor..." If there is a prefix, either it is "(I beg your) Pardon..." or it is the wrong "Excuse me..."... From such examples, we can see the power and omnipresence of that "curse".

Professor [Robert Morton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton) discovered this phenomenon and named it "self-fulfilling prophecy".

> When people believe that something will happen (in fact, that thing may not necessarily happen), then this will eventually really happen.

Western mythology is full of such stories:

> After Thebes (Thebes) King Laius (Laius) and Queen Jocasta (Jocasta) gave birth to Oedipus, they received a divine oracle saying that this child would eventually kill his father and marry his mother. In order to avoid misfortune, Laius pierced the newborn's ankle (oidipous in Greek means "swollen foot"), and let the shepherd abandon the child in the wild to die.

> But the shepherd couldn't bear it, so he secretly sent the child to the king of Corinth (Corinth), Polybus (Polybus). Polybus liked this child very much, so he raised him as his own child. After Oedipus grew up, he learned from the temple oracle that he would eventually kill his father and marry his mother; but he did not know that King Polybus and the queen were not his biological parents. In order to avoid the oracle from coming true, he left Corinth and swore never to return.

> Later, Oedipus had a conflict with a group of strangers at a fork in the road during his wandering, and accidentally killed people, including his biological father Laius. And then because he solved the riddle of the Sphinx (Sphinx), he inherited the throne of Thebes and married the widow of the king.

> After Oedipus ascended the throne, Thebes kept suffering from disasters, including plagues. So Oedipus sought help from the gods. After the prophet Tiresias (Tiresias) revealed, Oedipus knew that he was the son of Laius, and the unfortunate fate of killing his father and marrying his mother was finally fulfilled. The shocked Jocasta hanged herself in shame, and the equally sad Oedipus blinded his own eyes.

And Professor Morton used the example of a bank run to explain the mechanism of self-fulfilling prophecy:

> A bank was operating well, but somehow rumors began to say that the bank was going to go bankrupt. The rumors spread more and more widely, more and more people began to believe it to be true, and some people started to run to the bank to withdraw their deposits; and then panic began to spread and become real, more people rushed into the bank to withdraw their deposits... In the end, a run on the bank occurred, and the bank really went bankrupt.

The operation mechanism of self-fulfilling prophecy is somewhat confusing: good things rarely come true as expected, but bad things often can come out of nothing. But it is not impossible to explain clearly: perhaps this is related to the "fear emotion" psychology deeply rooted in the human brain. Relatively speaking, joy will make a person stop acting to enjoy joy, but fear is just the opposite, it will cause a person to take action immediately to avoid danger - even if sometimes it is contrary to wish. In fact, decisions made out of fear are almost always contrary to wish.

Once this curse is activated, it is almost impossible to prevent it from taking effect, which is precisely what makes it terrifying. We are fortunate to live in an era that has proven this curse does not exist. Thanks to the relentless efforts of Edward Taub and many other scientists, we finally know for sure that this curse does not exist, and the fears of the past were unnecessary. I am also grateful to my students over the years, who have clearly shown me countless successful facts, allowing me, many of their subsequent students, and my readers to emerge from the "Dark Ages" into a sky full of morning glow.

In modern medical terms, this condition is called "Stroke": The blood vessels suddenly become blocked due to some reason (such as the presence of a thrombus) and cannot supply blood to the brain, which then causes some brain cells to die, and the resulting brain injury causes some parts of the body to lose sensation.

## 6. 不要再 “学” 英语，你就该 “用” 英语！

语言是人类最宝贵的工具，然而，有些时候，语言也有副作用，给使用它的人带来限制。从某种意义上毫不夸张地说，“学” 这个字很可能实际上是很多人语言习得路上的最大障碍之一。因为人们往往对 “学” 这个字充满了敬畏，甚至常常是不必要的敬畏。

这种敬畏体现在大多数人总是假定不论是什么事情，都要先 “学” 好了之后才能 “用”。这个假定在很多情况下确实是正确的。比如，如果你想以医生为职业，那么你必须通过考试获得行医资格之后被允许救死扶伤；如果你想以律师为职业，那么你也必须通过考试获得律师资格之后才可以去匡扶正义。哪怕再简单一些的技能也可能如此，比如，你买了一辆车想将其作为代步工具，那么就必须通过考试获得驾照之后才被允许开车上路 —— 无证驾驶是违法的。

然而，这个假定并不适用于英语这项技能的习得及应用（或者说，其他的第二语言、甚至第三语言）。司机、医生、律师需要通过考试才能应用所需技能的重要原因在于这些技能的应用如若出现差错很有可能会对他人造成伤害 —— 甚至可能是无法挽回的。但是， 英语这项技能的应用在大多数情况下很难对他人造成伤害。你英文发音再难听，听的人也不会因此猝死；你英文语法错误再多，读的人也不会因此疼痛；别人对你说英文你没听懂或者给你看英文你没读懂，若非极端情况，你也不会因此就从此真的无颜见人。

而事实上，无论哪一种知识都必须经过实践才能够真正习得。即便医生必须先获得行医资格才能挂牌行医，但是，在此之前，他们都要经过很多年的实习才行──只不过，为了安全起见，他们的实习是在严格监管之下进行的。为了获得驾照，一定要有机会开车才能学会，只不过，通常情况下，在获得驾照之前基本上只能在驾校里开车……

只 “学” 不 “用”（这是大多数中国学生的写照）的下场就是在十几年之后依然在学依然无用（这是大多数中国学生的现实）。

既然 “用” 英语不会伤害任何人，既然不 “用” 就 “学” 不好，那莫不如从一开始就直接 “用”。

也可以这样理解：只有不断地 “用”，才能真正地 “学”，因为所有技能的习得，都要靠试错（Trial and Error）。很多人宁愿 “学一辈子”，却坚持 “一辈子不用” 的原因就在于害怕犯错。儿时犯错往往招致惩罚，成年之后，就算没有来自他人的惩罚，还有因为犯错而导致自己自卑和尴尬，所以，很多人是 “不惜一切代价” 避免出错的。然而，要知道知识的习得过程离不开试错，没有试错，就不可能有全面而真实的进步。所以，要知道犯错是正常的，甚至是不可或缺的。做事的时候，出错是必然的，如果正在做事却一点错都没有，那不是做事──那是在做梦。

把 “学” 改为 “用” 是很重要的，尽管看起来并没有什么了不起。书名《人人都能用英语》中的 “用” 字就是这个用意。而之前的章节标题中，我们的问题是 “我们有可能把外语用的比母语更好么？” 而不是 “我们有可能把外语学得比母语更好么？” 也是给予同样的考虑。

至于在哪儿用、怎么用，后面的章节中我们将从多个角度反复审视。然而，原则却很简单：你是怎么用母语的，你就应该怎么用英语。要对 “使用外语” 等闲视之──所谓 “使用一种语言”，本质上来看，不就是说话识字而已么？肯定不简单，但也绝对没有那么难。

## 7. 英文真的有用么？

好像每个人都知道英文很有用，必须学，并且必须学好。可是，你真的相信么？事实上，大多数人相信的是另外一回事儿。

我与无数的学生沟通，最终的结果是，大多数人 “学” 了英文十数年之后在现实世界中的应用只不过是考试而已。一路下来考了无数的试，中考、高考、四级、六级、考研、雅思、托福、SAT、GRE、GMAT……这过程中，什么时候不再考了，英文也就扔下了。

大多数人就是这样的：无论父母、老师、甚至整个社会如何灌输，他们骨子里其实并不相信英文有用。只不过，很多的时候，这种 “不相信” 并不那么明显，甚至非常隐蔽，很多人甚至在不断声称 “我对英文非常感兴趣” 的同时，其实并不相信英文真的不可或缺。

而现实也确实无时不刻地在向我们布道：没有英文地球照样转，生活照样缤纷多彩。看看自己的身边吧。你父母都精通英文么？也许不是，可他们不都过得好好的么？你那个生意上很成功的远方亲戚懂英文么？不懂。甚至，可能都没有受过所谓的高等教育，那不还是好好的么？不懂英文怎么了？不懂就不懂，大不了请个翻译，翻得不好就再换一个……

道理再清楚不过：如果有一样东西你必须学，它不可或缺，你学不会就无法继续生活 …… 那这样东西不用任何人逼你，不用任何人向你灌输 “它太有用了！”，你都会玩命地去搞定它。假设有人挡住你的去路，阻挠你学那个不可或缺的它，你甚至可能为此拼命……

生活中，随处可见 “自己并不知道自己并不相信” 的例子。这也是大多数父母教育孩子失败的重要原因之一。

几乎每个父母都教育自己的孩子 “最好练一手好字”。可事实上，绝大多数父母最终只能不了了之──观察下自己的周边吧，写一手好字的人从来都是极少数（当然，任何领域都只有极少数人做到好）。问题出在哪儿？

以下是我在某处读来的一位父亲的苦恼：

> 昨天女儿给我讲，爸爸，我不想学书法了。我这个人很民主，肯定不搞棍棒教育，真拿起棍棒来，我们家也是女儿打我这个“怪兽”，都是中奥特曼的毒太深。于是我问她：是不是觉得写书法很枯燥呢？是的！那我又问她：你想不想成为学校很牛的学生呢？想！那要成为很牛的学生，要不要成绩好？要！每次成绩都考90分能不能成为很牛的学生？（她的成绩目前还不能稳定做到过90）女儿想了半天，我又启发，是不是成绩好的经常考100分？对。每次都考100分难不难？难。但如果你每次能考90分，又会打乒乓球，又会写毛笔字，那是不是不一样？嗯。那这样的小朋友是不是有特长，才很牛？对。那你要不要成为这样的小朋友？要！那是不是应该坚持学好毛笔字？不学！诱导半天，启发失败，看来女儿聪明，知道我绕弯子教育她，虽然六岁不到，但总是逆反回答，也让人头痛。唯小人及女子其为难养也！我这女儿两样都占全了！

这位父亲 “启发” 失败的原因在于，他一方面向孩子有意识地灌输 “书法很有用”（尽管他的 “尽力启发” 实际上很牵强），但，另外一方面他在无意识地向孩子传递 “书法不好也没啥” 的事实。

如果，这位父亲是一位喜欢书法，每天都在精练书法，也经常因此常常被人夸奖的人，那么他的女儿可能无需他 “有意启发”，早就开始自愿天天练字了。可事实是相反的：这位父亲自己并不练书法，而女儿也看到父亲书法不怎样也无所谓（却让我练书法──不公平！），这种 “无声的事实” 是很强大的，强大到绝不可掩盖的地步。

曾有人质疑我，“那如果我作为父母，不懂英文的话，按你的说法，我让自己的孩子学英文倒是不行的了？！”

父母期望孩子学好任何一样东西，都是天经地义的。可是，仅仅出于好意是不够的。如果仅靠 “一番好意” 就可以成就事情，那这世界该多美好！可惜，现实并非如此。

潜移默化的教育最有效。

高考的时候，我在大学里做英语教授的父亲帮我选择了会计专业，而事实上，我一天的会计都没有做过。我自作主张，在大学毕业之后，做了几年的销售。而后几经辗转，居然跑去从事英语教学。这样的 “巧合” 其实背后有着必然的联系。

因为讲课受学生欢迎，我常常被要求去培训新教师。在培训教师的过程中，我很意外地发现，经常有人（比例远远超出我最初的想象）问我这样的问题：“李老师，你讲了这么多年的课，是不是早就不用再备课了？” 说实话，我很惊讶，他们怎么会问出这样的问题？尤其当遇到师范专业毕业生问这样的问题，我就更是惊诧莫名了──备课怎么可能有尽头呢？讲到老就要备到老啊！

经过一段时间的反思，我才想明白。从小，我就看到父亲每天晚饭之后都在备课。那教科书的页边页眉早就被密密麻麻的笔记填满，再过两学期，那书里又会多出许多夹页 …… 所以，我从小就以为 “老师都是这样的”（当然现在已经知道其实并非如此）。所以，有一天，我 “竟然” 做了老师，也就按照 “都是那样” 的方式做事 …… 而问我那个问题的人，尽管是师范专业毕业的，他们没见过我父亲那种老师，所以，他们不会像我那样认为 “老师都是那样的”，于是，他们以为的是另外一个样子……

从他人身上获得的这种潜移默化的影响极为强大。看来 “自己相信或者不相信” 的影响，对自己更加潜移默化，影响力更加强大。

2003 年，我开始去健身房。经过一段时间，身边的很多人觉得我去健身房很有效果，于是，也都纷纷报名买了健身卡。我身边的人当然绝大多数是老师。
我是请健身教练的，那价格不高不低：一小时 150 元。十几位老师之中，只有我一个人请教练。私下里，他们认为我花钱太大手大脚了，另外，他们也觉得一小时 150 元不值。

从我的角度，我不太理解为什么这些自身职业为教师的人却不肯花钱请教练。
观察了很久，也有过几次讨论，我自己有了个结论，尽管这些不肯花钱请教练的人肯定不赞同这个结论：他们不相信教学的作用──尽管他们是老师，他们甚至很可能在课堂上讲的就是自己不相信的东西 …… 别惊讶，尽管你会觉得我多少有些偏激，但我确信很多老师一生都在讲授自己并不相信的东西。所以，潜移默化之中，他们根本不相信健身教练能教他们什么有用的东西，因为他们教别人的东西之中也有很多是自己都知道根本没有用的──尽管他们自己并不见得清楚自己真正的想法。

不到半年的时间里，这些人都不再去健身房了，现在，整个健身房里，只有我一个人是七年的会员。最重要的是，在健身教练的指导下，这么多年，我在健身房从未受伤。事实上，很多人不是坚持不下去，而是在练的过程中由于方法不当，最终造成了各种各样的损伤，于是，无法练下去了 …… 并且，教练在大约两年之后，基本上就教完了，普通人没必要请一辈子教练的。经过这样迂回地讲解，读者应该能够理解很多人声称 “对英文感兴趣” 或 “英文很重要等”，但实际情况却并非如此。

“叶公好龙” 这个成语早已存在超过千年。这不是什么稀奇的现象，也没那么难以理解。

另外，对于那些希望自己孩子学好英文自己却一点都不懂的父母来说，倒是有个实用的建议：为了让孩子自然而然地学，父母就应该跟孩子一起学──我的意思是 “真学”，而不是做做样子。如果，你坚信英文有用，一定会有所挣扎；只要挣扎，就一定会有进步；只要有进步，就一定会开心，相信我，开心是传染性非常高的。当然，如果发现自己确实做不到，那么，请你也别对孩子有太多要求，随他去吧，看他自己的造化。

## 8. 我自己是从什么时候开始确认英文有用的？

最初的时候，我的英文成绩不仅不好，甚至应该正确描述为 “很差” 才对。从小我就被误解，很多人误以为我英文成绩一定会不错，因为我的父亲是英文教授。

可恰恰因为我父亲是英文教授，我才学不好！这不是什么奇怪的现象，而是普遍现象──看看实际情况吧，一般来说，教师子女成绩不好的情况其实很常见；并且，子女学不好很可能恰恰是父母所教授的那一门课程。

可能性是这样的：教师把耐心全都耗费在学生身上了，以至于回到家里，对自己的孩子却不知不觉失去了耐心。这就是发生在我身上的事情，小时候父亲也尝试教我英文，可总是几句话之后就一巴掌打过来，“这么笨，是我儿子么！” 我也倔强，“你不说我是捡来的么！哼！” 然后就是不欢而散。

然而，有一天，注定要发生的事情终于发生了 。

大学的时候，几经辗转，我终于搞到了一本英法对照（不是 “中英对照”）的 “Animal Farm”。乔治•奥威尔的这本书，在我成长的年代是一本禁书[^10]。人是很奇怪的动物，如果这书让你随便看你还未必愿意看；可如果它是禁书，你就有无穷无尽的动力去搞到它。

这本书被推崇为上个世纪最伟大的政治预言。薄薄的册子，讲述了一个看似平实却又惊天动地的故事：

> 一个农场里，一头老猪趁着酒鬼农场主出门的时机，把所有动物召集到谷仓，给大伙开了个会。

> 这头老猪颤颤巍巍爬上谷堆，张口说：“I had a dream……”

> 没说几句话，农场主琼斯就醉醺醺地回来了，大伙之后四散。

> 第二天，这头老猪就去世了，大伙记不得它究竟都说了些什么，却一想起来就很激动，也不知道为什么……

> 猪是所有动物里最聪明的。老猪去世之后不久，两头猪，一头叫拿破仑，另一头叫雪球，带着大伙起义了，把琼斯赶走，自己占领了农场，建立了动物共和国……

> 这些动物甚至有宣言的：“All animals are born equal.”

> 再后来，猪们发现酒很好喝。可问题在于，酒不是无穷无尽的，不够喝。于是就有猪建议，“只有猪才能喝酒。”可问题又来了，外面的墙上明明写着“All animals are born equal.”于是，酒足饭饱之后，一头猪去在墙上又刷了一些字。

> 第二天，所有的动物们都看到了，墙上的标语长了一点点：“All animals are born equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”
……

拿到这本书的时候，我已经寻它好几年了，很容易想象我当时如饥似渴的程度。而那与英文对照的法文并没有让我沮丧，因为我知道怎么查词典──查词典多有用，本书后面会提到。我花了大约半个月的时间才读完这本书，却一点都不觉得辛苦。甚至不知不觉就读完了──可事实上那是半个月啊！
许多年后，回想起这件事请，我知道 “Animal Farm” 的内容对我的影响并没有另外一件事情更大。读过这本书之后，我脑子里闪过的是这样一个句子：“English, for me, means freedom.”
自由的感觉真好。

或许对你而言学英语不是为了自由，但不管是什么，只要你发现了，你的动力将无穷尽。

[^10]: 现在这本书早已经不再是禁书，你甚至可以在新浪读书频道里面找到这本书的全本中译版《动物农庄》。

## 9. 寻找英文对你的真正的用处

对每个人来说，英文的用处应该是非常不一样的。即便是听说读写译这几个方面，人与人之间的要求也可能有天壤之别。

不过，无论如何，一定要想明白对自己来说，英文真正的用处在哪儿？

听与读是输入，说与写是输出，译，从来都不可能是机械的──否则 Google 翻译早就该替代人工翻译了。翻译，实际上大部分工作内容是 “再创作”。

事实上，对每个人来说，输入很可能要远比输出重要得多。因为输出依赖于输入，要先输入足够的信息，经过处理（思考）之后才能获得输出结果。所以，没有输入哪儿来的输出？即便是输入本身，都是有一定要求的，因为，把大脑比作计算机的话，我们可以将那个著名的计算机理论应用到大脑运行机制中：“Garbage in, garbage out.” 进来的是垃圾，出去的就是垃圾──变废为宝往往只不过是传说而已……

我一直认为大多数人其实没必要害怕自己只学到了 “哑巴英语”。事实上，绝大多数人其实开口说英语的机会并不多。我当然不是反对开口说英语，我只是在讲述一个事实：对很多人来说，其实只要能够流利阅读英语或许已经足够了。
能够流利阅读英语的好处很多。自由两个字基本上就是最大的概括。比如，我们可以直接阅读一手的文献资料，而不必经过漫长的等待之后去读实际上错误百出的译文。译文往往并不靠谱，因为翻译真的是很难很难的工作。很多的时候，译文不靠谱都怪不得译者，起码，至少有一部分语言是根本无法翻译的。如若你能够流利阅读英语，那你在阅读译作的时候，一定会时不时笑出来──很多翻译错的句子，你甚至可以根据经验在脑子里还原出原本的英文。不用依赖翻译，是一种莫大的解脱。当你的英文阅读熟练到一定程度之时，你会自然而然地庆幸，那是一种千金不换的庆幸。不过，现在还没到那时候，至于当下么，信不信只能由你。

另外一个不争的事实是，英文是科技文献量最大的语言，在这方面它全面超越所有语言。所以，一旦你需要查阅科技文献，基本上只能去用英文。对另外一些特定的人群来说，写可能更重要。我认识很多外媒驻中的工作人员就是如此。尽管他们讲英文也相当流利，但是，他们自己清楚，写的能力对他们来说有多么的关键。于是，他们将尽一切可能去提高他们的检索能力、思考能力及写作能力。为了更快更准地获取关键信息，他们还要耗费大量的时间精力去编织必要的人际关系 …… 千万不要误以为写出几千字的文章只需要词汇语法知识就可以。

我并不想唱反调，我不仅同样认为口语能力很重要，并且也深知练就熟练的口语究竟有多难。因为我自己就是耗费了很多时间，走了很多弯路才做到可以正常表达。

口语之所以难以习得，是因为它本身属于输出，所以，一定要比输入难度高很多。有效的输出，不仅需要有效的输入，还需要有效的处理（思考），这样来看，练就流利的口语比练就流利的阅读难上八倍都不止……

不过，无论如何，输入是基础。很多人无法输出的根本原因在于输入太少。究竟少到什么程度，他们自己并不清楚。这句话可以用在任何一个学习的领域：**不知道并不可怕，可怕的是自己不知道 “自己不知道”**。


## 10. 我们过去对自己要求太低了……

过去，我们不仅不相信自己能够学好、用好英语，更为重要的是，即便挣扎其中，我们都对自己要求太低了，乃至于 “学傻” 或者 “被教傻”。

除了之前提到的 “词汇量”（高考词汇大纲）之外，还有就是阅读量。我们的初中英语教材中的课文，从几句话一篇开始，最终每篇没超过 500 词；高中英语教材中的课文每篇也就不到 1000 词；大学英语精读教材中的课文最长也就 2500 词。它们的共同特征是：要求学生几天内（最长一周）读完、学完一篇课文。

如果把阅读比作跑步，把我们初中时期的课文比作 100 米，那么很多人 “学” 了很多年英语之后，渐渐能够适应的、最长的距离只不过是 2000 米左右 …… 多年来习惯于最长阅读量是 2000 词，导致的结果是，看一会儿英文就头疼 …… 事实上，在读到 1000 词的时候，大脑就开始说 “再坚持一下啊！” 到 1500 词的时候说 “顶住！” 到 1800 词的时候大脑在不停地喊 “差不多了，就这样吧……”

可是，一个正常人是怎样使用语言的呢？看看我们自己使用母语的情况吧：

> 小学的时候，识字其实也没有怎么太过痛苦。甚至，很多孩子在幼儿园阶段就已经识字不少了。

> 在你初中毕业之后，中文阅读能力早就达到这样的水平：在坐地铁（或其他交通工具）前往某处的三十分钟里，你大概能把一本《读者》杂志从头到尾翻阅完毕。在这个过程里，你可以轻松分辨哪些文章“没劲，懒得看”，哪些文章“嗯！好像不错！”而读完之后，文章的好坏你早就判断完毕，如果好的话，回头你还会向你的朋友推荐，甚至为了推荐把那文章的内容向朋友重新复述一遍……

> 当然，如果你是大学毕业生，初中过后又有七年的高强度阅读积累（在学校里不论我们情愿与否，都要大量阅读），你的阅读能力早就登上另外一个台阶：大多数杂志报纸在你侯车或排队的过程中就能被消化掉，大多数小说你可以几个下午之内搞定，甚至，对你来说，很多专业书籍也根本不需要“一学期”的长度……

所以，在正常情况下，大多数正常人每天都在语言的使用上 “跑马拉松”，并且还是在毫不费力的情况下。

最为关键的是，最初阅读文字可能会比较累（想想我们小时候背着词典上学的过程吧）。但是，很快就会渐入佳境。那之后，大多数人其实是在 “享受文字”。用它获取信息，用它娱乐精神，用它沟通交流，而不是 “研究语文”。

现在，对比下我们在英语上的学习过程，只能说过去我们对自己要求太低了。
我们应该做的是，用最快的速度完成对 “马拉松” 的适应，而后哪怕每天 “马拉松” 也不觉得异常，甚至应该早忘记当初的痛苦，而去专注于语言的主要功用：用英语获取信息，用英语交流……**反正，用就是了。**
