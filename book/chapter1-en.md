# Chapter 1: The Starting Point

## 1. Can we possibly use a foreign language better than our mother tongue?

Yes.

In the past, I didn't believe it, just like you. But now, I do believe it because over the years, I have taught many students who have achieved this. I have witnessed too many such "miracles" that are commonplace in the eyes of others.

All multilingual users are the same. Ultimately, among the multiple languages they use, there is always a "dominant language". Which one is the dominant language does not depend on which one is the mother tongue, but on which language is used the most.

I have been a bilingual user since I was a child - because I am Korean. Korean and Chinese are both my mother tongues, and I have been fluent in both since I was a child. However, as time went by, because the frequency of using Chinese in life far exceeded that of Korean, in the end, Chinese became my dominant language - just because I used it the most.

In the past five years, I have brought out many high school students. They started preparing for studying abroad from the first year of high school (some a little later). While ensuring their schoolwork, they need to make extra efforts to get high scores in TOEFL, get high scores in SAT, so that they can go to prestigious universities in the United States in the fall of the third year of high school. The earliest group of high school students I came into contact with have now graduated from undergraduate studies, and most of them are pursuing doctoral degrees in Ivy League schools...

For these people, from a practical point of view, their dominant language may no longer be their mother tongue, but English. Because in the stage of their rapid growth and the most concentrated and rich acquisition of knowledge and information, they use almost all English. In fact, in the three years before they left China, their English level had far exceeded the imagination of others - many students scored more than 2300 points in the SAT: such scores, even among Americans, are one in a hundred. After arriving in the United States, just looking at their reading volume, it can only be getting bigger and not smaller, and the frequency of their use of English and Chinese, especially in listening and speaking, has long been separated. (Note, after 2016, the total score of SAT was changed to 1600.)

Even some of them (not necessarily a minority), from the moment they entered a prestigious American school, began to learn another foreign language, such as French, Spanish, German, etc.; and two or three years later, they can already use the "third language" proficiently in listening, speaking, reading and writing...

When I hold lectures at domestic universities, I often mention these students, and many students who are struggling for the CET-4 and CET-6 often express their doubts to me: "Cut, who believes it?", "How is it possible!" I understand. For them, this kind of thing is absolutely impossible - although, that's just what they think is impossible.

"Can we use a foreign language better than our mother tongue?"

The answer to this question is "yes".

And this answer of only one word is very important.

Although not everyone can do it, but, "can" or at least "possible" this fact, will change everything, at least can change everything for some people. It's like there's always a small part of people who really understand: no matter how big the difference between 1 and 99 is, it's not as big as the difference between 0 and 1.

Knowing the answer to this word is likely to be the starting point for some people to be reborn.

## 2. But why can't most people learn well?

"I've been studying for so many years, why am I getting worse and worse..."

This was my confusion. Over the years, I have given lectures and taught classes all over the place, and I have also learned that many, many people have more or less the same feelings - I am not alone.

Why are we getting worse and worse?

Because we never believed that we could learn and do well!

What is even more chilling after thinking about it is: we may not even know that "we have never believed".

In our bones, the vast majority of us never believe that we can learn a foreign language well - let alone multiple languages. Those who are proficient in multiple languages are gifted in our eyes, "different from us ordinary people".

Although we have been "working hard" to learn English for many years in the past (six years of elementary school, six years of middle school, four years of undergraduate...), the actual effect is very small. Once willing to face it squarely, every person who has "worked hard to learn English" for ten years and has not achieved it will admit: in these years, the actual learning time is very little.

On the one hand, we do know that English is very useful so it is best to learn it, on the other hand, because we do not believe in our bones that we can actually learn it, we do not actually work hard, and on the other hand, these two diametrically opposed views cause learners to be anxious and helpless.

What is it that makes us "never believe"? What is it that makes us "never believe" and yet not know it?

There may be many reasons. But our high school English textbooks are definitely the culprit (at least one of them). In our country, the vocabulary outline for the college entrance examination is basically composed of about 3500 words. Due to different regions and different textbooks, let's calculate a little more, let's calculate it as 3600. Although we don't know what impact this number will have on us, the indisputable fact is that we do know this number - at least we know it roughly.

Before graduating from high school, we have studied English for at least 6 years - elementary school and kindergarten are not counted. So what does this mean? The number 3600 tells us that we can learn 600 English words a year - if we really do it, then in the English test of the college entrance examination, the score will definitely be among the best... There are 365 days a year, so how many words do we need to learn a day? Less than 2 is enough...

The number of English words in the vocabulary outline for the college entrance examination silently conveys such a message to every child:
1. English is very difficult, very difficult...
2. You are very stupid, very stupid...
3. It's amazing to be able to learn two words a day!

Yeah. That's it.

In the spring of 2010, I completed the first draft of this book. At that time, I still felt it was difficult to explain this truth clearly and clearly to readers. Fortunately, in the fall of 2010, Hollywood director Christopher Nolan made a blockbuster that was praised all over the world - "Inception" (translated as "Dream Space"). This title (literally translated as "implantation") has become a well-known concept. This helped me a lot! Nolan explained to the audience in the movie: an idea must be simple enough to be implanted; the simpler the idea, the more deeply rooted it is after being implanted; because the person who has this idea cannot tell whether this idea is his own or implanted... The same is true, the vocabulary outline for the college entrance examination is in this way, quietly "implanting" that extremely simple idea into our brains, and then making it deeply rooted and affecting our lives...

Many times, **people are stupid because they are taught**. Education has always played a role in failure - so success is bound to be accidental. The weird thing about education is that if you educate students as geniuses, students are almost destined not to become geniuses, because geniuses are self-taught; but if you educate students as idiots, then students will definitely become idiots - because people are stupid because they are taught.

Fortunately, everyone has the right to self-study, and in fact, no matter who it is, they have more or less certain self-study ability. What's better is that some knowledge can be instantly understood and put into effect. The previous section answered this question, "Can we use a foreign language better than our mother tongue?" The answer is "yes". Knowing the meaning of this answer is that it can root out the previously implanted ideas.


## 3. Why do some people "easily" master it?

Contrary to those who "get worse the more they learn," there are some people, perhaps a minority, who easily master and excel - just like the "lucky ones" I mentioned earlier who are already studying at prestigious universities in the United States.

The question is, they were also implanted with the same idea - they also studied in high schools in China, used the same textbooks, attended the same classes, and encountered the same English teachers... So why weren't they affected?

The answer is, they were implanted with another idea, even though they might not know the truth themselves.
Most of these students grew up in urban cities in China, where there would be at least one institution providing TOEFL/SAT training.

The existence of such training institutions itself is more important than their "teaching quality". These training institutions are constantly spreading a message: there is an exam called TOEFL (in recent years they have also let more people know about another exam, called SAT), many people go to learn, many people go to take the exam, and in the end, many people get high scores (whether the people who get the message make a logical error here is not important, what is important is that even this kind of erroneous logical relationship is an important component of the powerful information that is transmitted externally)... What's even more important is that those who go to learn, take the exam, and finally get high scores are right next to them; when people see that "even those who are not as good as themselves " go to learn, take the exam, and finally get high scores, taking action is just natural.

In other words, the fact of "the existence of such training institutions" itself may be more meaningful and influential to students than "going to a certain training institution for classes". This is not my own theory, in fact, there is a special course abroad called "Power of the place" - a branch of geography, which specifically studies this mechanism and its influence.

This is the power of concept. If you don't know the existence of the TOEFL exam, you may not even have the opportunity to take the exam. If you don't think it's an exam that can get a high score, you may not even try to work hard. Just because you know its existence, you may start to work hard; just because you see that "even those who are not as good as you" (although this may simply be an illusion) get high scores, you have no reason not to work hard, and in the end, you may also get high scores...

In fact, "**I can do it too**" these three words are the most realistic and effective motivation for the vast majority of ordinary people. This is especially true in areas like learning a second language that basically do not rely on talent.

[^2]: People often misunderstand the causal relationship: they see that others go to participate in a certain training first, and then get high scores, so they think that there is a causal relationship between "that training class" and "getting high scores"; this is no different from "thinking that the rooster calls up the sun" in essence.

[^3]: People always tend to overestimate themselves. For example, an interesting survey found that more than 70% of drivers believe that their driving skills are above average. So, "even those who are not as good as themselves" is often just an illusion.


## 4. How Do Beliefs Influence Me?

The power of beliefs can be so profound that a slight shift in one's beliefs can potentially change a person's entire life.

Penetrating the surface to reach the essence is not as easy as it sounds. Historians have reached a consensus after many years of research that it was not the advanced weaponry of the Europeans that defeated the Native Americans, but the viruses that existed on the Europeans, which were invisible and intangible to both the Europeans and the Native Americans at the time. These viruses caused the Native Americans to fall ill and die in droves, making the Europeans appear to have "divine assistance"...

So, often the actual root of the problem is far removed from the seemingly obvious manifestation. The power of beliefs has also had a dramatic impact on me personally.

About twenty years ago (around 1988), when I first started high school, a professor of English in my father's research office took the TOEFL test and scored 570 points (out of a total of 677). When people talked about it, they all said, "That's a pretty good score!" (Because a professor had taken the test before and scored 530...) Although I didn't understand what kind of test it was, it left an impression on me: it was a difficult test.

A few years later, in 1993, when I was a junior in college, a classmate from the next class was said to be preparing for the TOEFL. Looking back, college students in Beijing were preparing for this test in full swing, but in Changchun at the time, no one knew about this test. There, I was considered well-informed. One night when we were talking about this in the dormitory, I told everyone how difficult the TOEFL test was. When everyone heard that a college professor had only scored 570, they stuck out their tongues and all said, "This is simply not a test for humans!" After that, we gave that classmate a nickname - "Beast".

That summer, I went to Beijing to find a high school classmate who was studying at Tsinghua University and asked him to help me assemble a 486 computer. On the way, he pointed to a bungalow and said, "That's New Oriental." He said it as if I should know. So I asked, "What's New Oriental?" He told me it was an English training institution, and if you want to go abroad, you should take a course there. It is said that college students are spreading the word: "Going there doesn't necessarily guarantee a high score, but not going there definitely means you won't get a high score." This topic quickly passed, and we continued to chat about something else, which I have long since forgotten...

Many years later, one day after I had been teaching at New Oriental for several years, I suddenly remembered that many, many years ago, when Yu Minhong was still in the start-up phase, I had actually heard of New Oriental...
And the discussion in the dormitory at that time was quickly forgotten by the students. I don't even remember the name of that classmate now. Of course, I don't know how many points he scored on the TOEFL, but I do know that he went to the United States the following year.

At the end of 2000, I had graduated from college for many years, during which time I had made a lot of money in sales and wholesale, and then spent all my savings at home taking care of my sick father. I was in desperate need of a stable job. Later, a friend from high school called me from Beijing and said, "Xiaolai, come to Beijing, teach at New Oriental, the income is good." By this time I had forgotten that I had heard about New Oriental from a classmate in Beijing six years ago, and just asked him, "Are you sure the income is not low?" The friend said, "Don't worry, with your eloquence, you'll definitely be fine!" So I took the train to Beijing, enrolled in a course at New Oriental, bought a variety of question sets at the door of New Oriental with difficulty, and then locked myself in a small one-bedroom apartment on the 11th floor of Shuangyushu, Haidian District for four months, took the TOEFL, took the GRE, and applied to New Oriental with my amazing scores. Then I taught there for seven years in one breath. During this period, New Oriental Education & Technology Group was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with the ticker symbol EDU.

In 2003, on the day "TOEFL Core Vocabulary 21 Days Breakthrough" was published and distributed, I invited guests, and a bunch of friends chatted casually. Somehow, I suddenly remembered the situation when I passed by the old site of New Oriental in Zhongguancun in 1994 (which was about ten years ago) when I was assembling a computer, and then I suddenly remembered the classmate who we had nicknamed "Beast", and I couldn't help but shiver.

Before this shiver, I always felt that it was something to brag about that I locked myself in a small room for four months at the "old age" of 28 in 2000 and got high scores on the TOEFL and GRE; but after this shiver, I suddenly realized that when I was "very naive" (1993), I could have taken the TOEFL and GRE, but at that time I thought it was "impossible"; and I even called that classmate "Beast" with the same self-righteousness as other classmates... If I had prepared for the TOEFL and GRE that year (instead of at the age of 28 - a difference of seven years!), now thinking back, if I had used my smart brain when I was still in school, maybe I wouldn't have needed four months (maybe three months?) to get a high score. If that were really the case, wouldn't my life afterwards be vastly different? Now thinking back, my mentality was simply "beastly", and I couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat as if it were pouring rain.

I often tell my students about this experience. People are like this, they hear a lot of truths and in the end they can't take them in, only real examples that they can see and touch will move them. Over the years, I know that my experience has brought enough impact to many students around me, changed some people, and changed some other things that I don't know about.


## 5. Is there a theoretical basis for such conclusions?

In the GRE exam, there is an essay topic:

> "No field of study can advance significantly unless outsiders bring their knowledge and experience to that field of study."

> Unless outsiders bring knowledge and experience from other fields, no field can make significant progress.

Although this statement is not always true, it is indeed a common phenomenon. For example, this book about second language acquisition (English learning) needs to start from elsewhere.

Two researchers from Johns Hopkins University, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, started an experiment at the end of 1959 that affected countless second language learners around the world for many years to come - although the impact was mainly negative - even though the purpose of the experiment itself did not seem to have a direct connection with foreign language learning: it was to study the early development of the animal visual system.

> They surgically sutured one eye of a cat or monkey that was a few months old; after a while, they reopened it. The research shows that even after reopening the sutured eyelid, these animals' eyes cannot regain visual function. Closing one eye for a period of time has a significant impact on the structure of the visual area in the animal's brain. However, visual deprivation for the same time or longer in adult cats will neither affect their visual ability nor affect their brain structure. Only young animals will be deprived of visual sensitivity during their "critical period" (Critical Period).

> ![](images/figure01.png)

> There are documentaries of this experiment on youtube:
> * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOHayh06LJ4
> * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE952yueVLA

This research and its results eventually won the two a Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1981, "because this research has made a huge contribution to understanding how the visual system processes information." But people seem to be more interested in the "critical period" concept proposed in this research. Scientists soon discovered that other parts of the brain also need to be stimulated to develop, and they seem to all conform to the critical period theory. According to the critical period theory, the brain is "plastic" (Plastic) only during the critical period, and the external stimuli received by the brain at this time may even change the structure of the brain; after the critical period, the brain is no longer plastic. Soon, the concept of "critical period" extended to various scientific fields.

Linguist Eric Heinz Lenneberg was born in Germany, fled to Brazil during World War II, and later immigrated to the United States. He studied at the University of Chicago and Harvard University. Later, as a professor of psychology and neurobiology, he taught at Harvard Medical School, the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, and Cornell University Medical School. Professor Lenneberg proposed the "Language Acquisition Critical Period Hypothesis" in 1967, believing that the critical period of language acquisition begins at birth and ends at some point between the age of eight and the end of adolescence. After the "critical period", the ability to acquire a second language will decline significantly, and it is impossible to remove the accent from the mother tongue.

In fact, Professor Lenneberg is quite cautious and proposes a "hypothesis" (Hypothesis). However, once almost all scientific research results enter the public communication field, they will more or less be mixed with misunderstandings, or even deliberately distorted. For example, after Martin Seligman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, proposed "Learned Optimism", it was immediately taken as a prop in their hands by the masters of success, regardless of Professor Seligman's reserved attitude and rigor. Similarly, when Professor Lenneberg's "hypothesis" came to the market, it became a "theory" (Theory). The original "beginning at birth, ending at some point between the age of eight and the end of adolescence" also became "beginning at 0 years old, ending at 10 years old" - on the other side of the ocean in China, this has almost become the main propaganda tool for all children's English projects, and the subtext of the purpose is nothing more than to scare parents to pay quickly, "otherwise it will be too late!". More commonly, this "critical period theory" has become an excuse for many people to comfort themselves. It is normal not to learn well, because "the critical period has long passed!" Or "it's not good if you don't learn when you were a child..." Or "I'm so old, there's no drama!", etc.

In fact, the real contribution of David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel is that they proved that the brain is "plastic", not unchanging. And their limitation lies in the "critical period" that people talk about. At that time, they were both staunch supporters of "regional theory"-and regional theory was not overturned by the academic community until a long time later.

![](images/figure02.png)

Regional theory (Localizationism) believes that the brain is like a complex machine, and each part of this machine has its specific function; and then, each specific function is limited by hardware (Hardwired). The implication of regional theory is that once a certain area of the brain is damaged, the function under the jurisdiction of that area cannot be recovered. And clinical observations seem to be able to confirm this conclusion: for example, the paralyzed limbs of stroke patients seem to be unable to recover no matter what.

![](images/figure03.png)

A very beautiful boy, isn't he? Have you noticed his eyes? This is not a special effect, this boy's eyes are so bright. This boy is a Sea Gypsy, their eyes are all so bright.

Sea Gypsies live near the west coast of Thailand and belong to nomadic people, but they live on seafood. Most of their lives are drifting at sea. This boy was born at sea. They can learn to swim before they learn to speak and walk. They can easily dive below 30 feet without using any equipment - a tribe called Suru often has to dive below 75 feet to pick pearls. They can control and lower their heart rate, thereby controlling their oxygen consumption, they can stay underwater for a long time, often twice as much as ordinary people.

Of course, the most surprising thing is their eyes. They can maintain good, and even better, vision underwater. This is because they have learned how to control the size of their pupils, being able to shrink their pupils by 22%. All along, people have believed that the contraction scale of the pupil is fixed (determined by human genes), and it should not be consciously controlled, subject to the "autonomic nervous system."

Scientists believe that this is not the result of a "genetic mutation," but the "plasticity" of the brain. Because scientist Anna Gislen and her colleagues brought the Sea Gypsies to Europe, they quickly taught a group of Swedish children how to constrict their pupils. Now scientists believe that the brain has strong plasticity and has always maintained this plasticity from beginning to end. All external stimuli (especially systematic training) will affect our brains, and the structure and function of the brain will change accordingly.

Ancient people observed that, "If they are not of my race, their hearts must be different." From this point of view, it is correct, because it seems that culture is constantly shaping the brains of people affected by this culture. What has always been considered a "hardware" limitation has now been clearly proven (at least in part) to be a "software" development problem. Our brain is like a magical computer - because its hardware even has the ability to "adapt" to the installed "software."

The reason why scientists infer that the "special function" of the Sea Gypsies is not the result of a "genetic mutation" is mainly based on two aspects:

1. Research shows that for tens of thousands of years, the structure of the human brain has hardly changed;
2. This ability can be learned within one generation without the need for genetic accumulation.

![](images/figure04.png)

In the past hundred years, a large number of "cave paintings" have been discovered all over the world. According to carbon isotope analysis, the oldest of these murals are works from thirty thousand years ago, and the most recent are about ten thousand years ago. These works often surprise and even frustrate modern painters. When Picasso visited the newly discovered Lascaux cave in the town of Dordogne, France in 1940, he saw these murals (one of them is shown in the picture above), and he was somewhat lost. Speaking of so-called modern art, he commented, "We have actually learned nothing."

In fact, this is not bad news. On the contrary, it is the best good news. People could make such magical works tens of thousands of years ago, indicating that the human brain at that time had sufficient potential, and our development and progress today, in a sense, is the result of developing this potential.

Anna Gislen taught a group of European children to constrict their pupils like the Sea Gypsies in just eight months, proving that this ability is not inherited. Perhaps most people can't see the specific practical significance of this proof, but for second language learners, this is undoubtedly a significant discovery. For a long time, there has been a debate in the scientific community: "Is language ability innate?"

In fact, there is no need to argue. Obviously, language ability is not innate, but acquired. In fact, the emergence of language and text has only been a few thousand years so far, and the human brain before that was not incapable of processing language and text, but there was no language and text available for processing. In fact, scientists have long discovered that they can teach people in primitive tribes to use "new" languages and texts within a generation. The same is true for our country's literacy work. Compared with other animals, humans have stronger language ability because the brain has a larger capacity and wider potential. Many scientists have successfully taught monkeys or other animals some human languages - it's just that their memory is too poor and their potential is limited, so they are unlikely to reach the human realm.

If it is said that, 1) the brain is plastic; 2) language ability is acquired, then theoretically, anyone can learn any language. But it doesn't seem to be the case in practice. And the "critical period" theory has cast a shadow on hope. Because according to the critical period theory, the brain is plastic only in the initial period. However, after two or three decades, scientists have finally proven:

1. The brain is plastic;
2. And it is plastic from beginning to end;
3. Even it can reorganize itself (Reorganizing), through proper training, it can use another area to acquire the ability of the damaged area...

However, this proof process is particularly difficult.
Can the reader guess from the picture below, is the little girl being treated at the [American UAB Rehabilitation Center](http://www.uabhealth.org) injured in her left arm or right arm?

![](images/figure05.png)

In fact, her left arm was not injured, and the reason why her left arm was fixed was because it was an uninjured arm, and the right arm was the injured one that needed to be recovered through training... Huh? What's going on? But from a physiological point of view, the damaged part of the brain cannot be recovered, so how can she recover the already injured right arm through training?

The magic of the brain is that it can use other undamaged parts to relearn the function of the damaged part (academically called "remap", "reroute", or "rewire"). The reason why the freely moving left arm needs to be tied up is that if it is not done, in the face of any demand, the part of the brain that controls the left arm (or called "left arm brain map") will "start first"; because this part is undamaged, and the part that originally controlled the right arm has been damaged. In other words, at this time, there is no part in the brain that can control the right arm. But after the left arm is fixed, even though the part of the brain that controls the left arm still "starts first", it can't actually manipulate the left arm freely. And in this case, you can let other parts of the brain slowly focus on the right arm, and then learn to control the right arm - that is, through such training, you can slowly make an undamaged part of the brain "learn" the function originally controlled by the damaged part. Before long, the girl's right arm recovered, and it was no different from the original when it moved. But her brain is no longer what it used to be, although a part of it is damaged and cannot be recovered, but another part of her brain has been developed and can complete the function that the damaged part could originally complete without any difference.

Just before 2004, this therapy was completely unimaginable. This initially incredible therapy is called "CI Activity Therapy" (Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy, abbreviated as "CI" or "CIMT") and its inventor is [Edward Taub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Taub) professor. Today, this therapy is gradually being popularized worldwide, helping countless hemiplegic patients to regain their original self and life. But Professor Taub's research experience has been ups and downs. In order to find a treatment plan for hemiplegia, he needs to artificially make monkeys hemiplegic (deliberately damage a part of the monkey's brain), and then try to train those monkeys to recover from hemiplegia... In the early 1980s, he was sued by an animal rights protection organization, causing the laboratory to be closed, funds to be frozen, and finally even lost his job, and almost everyone avoided him. In the next six years, all of Professor Taub's time and energy were consumed in defending himself - the huge social pressure made him unable to find a lawyer willing to defend him, so he had to be his own lawyer. Before the case, Professor Taub had a total of about 100,000 US dollars in savings. By the time he finally won the lawsuit and cleared all charges, he only had about four thousand dollars in savings. Of course, today, based on the huge value he has created for mankind with his theory and practice, Professor Taub is recognized as one of the most outstanding scientists in the world today.

The success of Professor Taub's CI therapy first proves that regionalism is wrong (at least not completely correct) - the brain can reorganize itself; secondly, it proves that the brain is plastic from beginning to end, and even can be reorganized - that is, use a new brain map to complete the function originally completed by the damaged brain map; the last and most important proof is: there is competition between brain maps - so, in order to cure the damaged right arm, you must first restrict the undamaged left arm. If the undamaged left arm is not restricted, then the brain map of the left arm will always be dominant, and then, the brain will produce "learned non-use" (Learned Nonuse) for the already damaged right arm.

This last point can be used to clearly explain the phenomenon that was wrongly explained by the "critical period theory": why is it more difficult to learn a second language after adulthood?

The reason why learning a second language seems more difficult after adulthood is not due to the "critical period" theory, which suggests that the brain is no longer plastic after this period. In fact, it is because the brain map used for the second language has to compete with the already powerful mother tongue brain map - of course, this becomes increasingly difficult. However, it is precisely this understanding that gives people hope. Currently, many educators are advocating "immersive learning", which has a certain basis and considerable effect. The so-called "immersive learning" is to force students to only use the second language and prohibit the use of the mother tongue in a specific time and environment, thereby stimulating the brain to accelerate the construction of a new brain map. The globally popular Rosetta Stone language learning software ([Rosetta Stone](https://www.rosettastone.com)) is developed based on this principle.

For second language learners, the most intuitive and meaningful good news is:
1. It's never too late to start learning;
2. As long as the method is appropriate and given time, you can definitely learn well.
3. Even, the second language may surpass the mother tongue and become the dominant language.

(Of course, in the following content, readers will know that there is a better method than "learning"......)
In learning this matter, believing that you can definitely learn well does not necessarily guarantee that you can really learn well; but on the contrary, if you believe that you cannot learn well, then you will definitely not be able to learn well in the end. The so-called "self-fulfilling prophecy" ([Self-fulfilling prophecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy)) is like this, always working negatively. In fact, the "critical period of language acquisition" has caused incalculable harm worldwide for more than forty years. Countless people have inadvertently turned "hypothesis" into "conclusion", believing that they cannot learn well, and thus become victims of "self-fulfilling prophecy".

"I have no talent", "I just can't learn well", "English is too difficult" and the like, even such thoughts, are actually powerful curses. They have both powerful and evil power. Observe the people around you, you will be surprised to find that many people who have learned English for many years, the most fluent and standard English sentence is: "I’m sorry, my English is poor..." If there is a prefix, either it is "(I beg your) Pardon..." or it is the wrong "Excuse me..."... From such examples, we can see the power and omnipresence of that "curse".

Professor [Robert Morton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Merton) discovered this phenomenon and named it "self-fulfilling prophecy".

> When people believe that something will happen (in fact, that thing may not necessarily happen), then this will eventually really happen.

Western mythology is full of such stories:

> After Thebes (Thebes) King Laius (Laius) and Queen Jocasta (Jocasta) gave birth to Oedipus, they received a divine oracle saying that this child would eventually kill his father and marry his mother. In order to avoid misfortune, Laius pierced the newborn's ankle (oidipous in Greek means "swollen foot"), and let the shepherd abandon the child in the wild to die.

> But the shepherd couldn't bear it, so he secretly sent the child to the king of Corinth (Corinth), Polybus (Polybus). Polybus liked this child very much, so he raised him as his own child. After Oedipus grew up, he learned from the temple oracle that he would eventually kill his father and marry his mother; but he did not know that King Polybus and the queen were not his biological parents. In order to avoid the oracle from coming true, he left Corinth and swore never to return.

> Later, Oedipus had a conflict with a group of strangers at a fork in the road during his wandering, and accidentally killed people, including his biological father Laius. And then because he solved the riddle of the Sphinx (Sphinx), he inherited the throne of Thebes and married the widow of the king.

> After Oedipus ascended the throne, Thebes kept suffering from disasters, including plagues. So Oedipus sought help from the gods. After the prophet Tiresias (Tiresias) revealed, Oedipus knew that he was the son of Laius, and the unfortunate fate of killing his father and marrying his mother was finally fulfilled. The shocked Jocasta hanged herself in shame, and the equally sad Oedipus blinded his own eyes.

And Professor Morton used the example of a bank run to explain the mechanism of self-fulfilling prophecy:

> A bank was operating well, but somehow rumors began to say that the bank was going to go bankrupt. The rumors spread more and more widely, more and more people began to believe it to be true, and some people started to run to the bank to withdraw their deposits; and then panic began to spread and become real, more people rushed into the bank to withdraw their deposits... In the end, a run on the bank occurred, and the bank really went bankrupt.

The operation mechanism of self-fulfilling prophecy is somewhat confusing: good things rarely come true as expected, but bad things often can come out of nothing. But it is not impossible to explain clearly: perhaps this is related to the "fear emotion" psychology deeply rooted in the human brain. Relatively speaking, joy will make a person stop acting to enjoy joy, but fear is just the opposite, it will cause a person to take action immediately to avoid danger - even if sometimes it is contrary to wish. In fact, decisions made out of fear are almost always contrary to wish.

Once this curse is activated, it is almost impossible to prevent it from taking effect, which is precisely what makes it terrifying. We are fortunate to live in an era that has proven this curse does not exist. Thanks to the relentless efforts of Edward Taub and many other scientists, we finally know for sure that this curse does not exist, and the fears of the past were unnecessary. I am also grateful to my students over the years, who have clearly shown me countless successful facts, allowing me, many of their subsequent students, and my readers to emerge from the "Dark Ages" into a sky full of morning glow.

[^4]: "Stroke" is actually a traditional Chinese medical concept. In modern medical terms, this condition is called "Stroke": The blood vessels suddenly become blocked due to some reason (such as the presence of a thrombus) and cannot supply blood to the brain, which then causes some brain cells to die, and the resulting brain injury causes some parts of the body to lose sensation.

[^7]: In the Chinese context (or traditional Chinese medicine context), hemiplegia is a symptom of stroke; Western medicine calls this "Stroke" - as mentioned before.

[^8]: This is another important concept that is enough to change your perception, isn't it?

[^9]: It was mentioned before that every multilingual user has a "dominant language". The formation of the dominant language is also based on this reason, because there is competition between brain maps.

## 6. Stop "Learning" English, You Should "Use" English!

Language is the most precious tool of mankind. However, sometimes, language can also have side effects, imposing limitations on its users. It's not an exaggeration to say that, in a certain sense, the word "learn" might actually be one of the biggest obstacles on the path of language acquisition for many people. This is because people often fill the word "learn" with awe, even often unnecessary awe.

This awe is reflected in the fact that most people always assume that no matter what it is, they must first "learn" it well before they can "use" it. This assumption is indeed correct in many cases. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you must pass an exam to obtain a medical license before you are allowed to save lives; if you want to be a lawyer, you must also pass an exam to obtain a lawyer's license before you can uphold justice. Even simpler skills may be like this, for example, if you buy a car and want to use it as a means of transportation, you must pass an exam to obtain a driver's license before you are allowed to drive on the road - driving without a license is illegal.

However, this assumption does not apply to the acquisition and application of English skills (or other second languages, or even third languages). The important reason why drivers, doctors, and lawyers need to pass exams to apply the required skills is that if these skills are applied incorrectly, they are likely to cause harm to others - and it may even be irreparable. But, the application of English skills in most cases is unlikely to cause harm to others. If your English pronunciation is hard to listen to, the listener will not die suddenly; if your English grammar errors are too many, the reader will not feel pain; if others speak English to you and you don't understand, or show you English and you can't read it, unless it's an extreme situation, you won't really lose face from then on.

In fact, any kind of knowledge must be practiced to truly acquire it. Even if doctors must first obtain a medical license to practice medicine, they must go through many years of internship before that - it's just that, for safety reasons, their internships are conducted under strict supervision. In order to obtain a driver's license, you must have the opportunity to drive to learn, but usually, before obtaining a driver's license, you can basically only drive in a driving school...

Only "learning" and not "using" (this is the portrayal of most Chinese students) will result in still learning and still useless after more than ten years (this is the reality of most Chinese students).

Since "using" English will not harm anyone, and if you don't "use" it, you can't "learn" it well, then it's better to just "use" it from the beginning.

It can also be understood this way: only by constantly "using" can you truly "learn", because the acquisition of all skills relies on trial and error. Many people would rather "learn for a lifetime", but insist on "not using it for a lifetime" because they are afraid of making mistakes. Making mistakes in childhood often leads to punishment, and when they grow up, even if there is no punishment from others, there is also self-abasement and embarrassment caused by making mistakes, so many people are "at all costs" to avoid making mistakes. However, you should know that the process of acquiring knowledge cannot be separated from trial and error, without trial and error, there can be no comprehensive and real progress. So, you should know that making mistakes is normal, and even indispensable. When doing things, making mistakes is inevitable, if you are doing things but there are no mistakes at all, that's not doing things - that's dreaming.

Changing "learning" to "using" is very important, although it doesn't seem to be anything remarkable. The word "use" in the book title "Everyone Can Use English" is this intention. And in the previous chapter titles, our question is "Can we use a foreign language better than our mother tongue?" instead of "Can we learn a foreign language better than our mother tongue?" is also given the same consideration.

As for where to use and how to use, we will examine it from multiple angles in the following chapters. However, the principle is very simple: how you use your mother tongue, you should use English. You should take the "use of a foreign language" lightly - the so-called "use of a language", in essence, isn't it just speaking and recognizing words? It's definitely not simple, but it's definitely not that difficult.

## 7. Is English Really Useful?

It seems that everyone knows English is useful, must be learned, and must be learned well. But do you really believe it? In fact, most people believe in something else.

I have communicated with countless students, and the final result is that most people "learn" English for more than a decade, and its application in the real world is nothing more than exams. Along the way, countless tests have been taken, including middle school exams, college entrance exams, CET-4, CET-6, postgraduate entrance exams, IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, GRE, GMAT... During this process, when there are no more exams, English is also abandoned.

Most people are like this: no matter how parents, teachers, or even the whole society instill, they actually do not believe in their bones that English is useful. However, many times, this "disbelief" is not so obvious, even very hidden, many people even constantly claim "I am very interested in English", but they do not believe that English is really indispensable.

And reality is indeed preaching to us all the time: without English, the earth still turns, and life is still colorful. Look around yourself. Are your parents proficient in English? Maybe not, but aren't they all living well? Does your distant relative who is very successful in business understand English? No. Even, he may not have received so-called higher education, isn't he still okay? What's wrong with not understanding English? If you don't understand, you don't understand. If it's a big deal, hire a translator. If the translation is not good, change another one...

The truth couldn't be clearer: if there is something you must learn, it is indispensable, and you can't continue to live if you can't learn it... Then you don't need anyone to force you, you don't need anyone to instill in you "it's too useful!", you will try your best to get it done. Suppose someone blocks your way and obstructs you from learning that indispensable thing, you might even fight for it...

In life, there are examples of "I don't know that I don't believe" everywhere. This is also one of the important reasons why most parents fail to educate their children.

Almost every parent educates their children to "practice good handwriting". But in fact, most parents can only give up in the end - observe your surroundings, people who write good handwriting have always been a minority (of course, only a minority of people do well in any field). Where is the problem?

Here is the distress of a father I read somewhere:

> Yesterday my daughter told me, Dad, I don't want to learn calligraphy. I am very democratic and definitely don't engage in stick education. If I really pick up the stick, in our house, it is also my daughter who beats me, this "monster", all are poisoned by Ultraman. So I asked her: Do you think writing calligraphy is very boring? Yes! Then I asked her again: Do you want to be a very awesome student in school? Want! To be a very awesome student, do you need good grades? Need! Can you become a very awesome student if you score 90 points every time? (Her grades are currently not stable enough to pass 90) The daughter thought for a long time, and I inspired again, isn't it often the good grades that score 100 points? Yes. Is it difficult to score 100 points every time? Difficult. But if you can score 90 points every time, you can play table tennis, and you can write brush words, isn't it different? Hmm. Isn't such a child a special talent, so awesome? Yes. Do you want to be such a child? Want! Shouldn't you insist on learning good brush words? Don't learn! After inducing for a long time, the inspiration failed. It seems that my daughter is smart and knows that I am educating her in a roundabout way. Although she is less than six years old, she always answers in reverse, which also makes people headache. Only small people and women are difficult to raise! My daughter takes up both!

The reason for the father's "inspiration" failure is that on the one hand, he consciously instills in his children that "calligraphy is very useful" (although his "best effort to inspire" is actually very far-fetched), but on the other hand, he unconsciously conveys to his children the fact that "it doesn't matter if calligraphy is not good".

If this father is a person who likes calligraphy, practices calligraphy every day, and is often praised by others because of this, then his daughter may not need him to "consciously inspire", and she has already voluntarily practiced writing every day. But the fact is the opposite: this father does not practice calligraphy himself, and the daughter also sees that it doesn't matter if the father's calligraphy is not good (but let me practice calligraphy - unfair!), this kind of "silent fact" is very powerful, powerful to the point where it cannot be concealed.

Someone once questioned me, "So if I am a parent and I don't understand English, according to what you said, it's not okay for me to let my child learn English?!"

It is justified for parents to expect their children to learn anything well. But it is not enough to just have good intentions. If you can accomplish things with "a good intention", how beautiful this world should be! Unfortunately, reality is not the case.

Subtle education is the most effective.

During the college entrance examination, my father, who was an English professor in college, helped me choose the accounting major, but in fact, I have never done accounting for a day. I took the initiative and did sales for a few years after graduating from university. After several twists and turns, I actually went to teach English. This kind of "coincidence" actually has a necessary connection behind it.

Because the lectures are popular with students, I am often asked to train new teachers. In the process of training teachers, I was surprised to find that often people (the proportion far exceeds my initial imagination) asked me such a question: "Teacher Li, you have been teaching for so many years, don't you need to prepare for class anymore?" To be honest, I was surprised, how could they ask such a question? Especially when I encounter graduates of normal universities asking such questions, I am even more surprised - how can I not prepare for class?

## 8. When did I start to realize the usefulness of English?

Initially, my English grades were not just bad, they should be correctly described as "very poor". From a young age, I was misunderstood. Many people mistakenly thought that my English grades would be good because my father was an English professor.

But precisely because my father was an English professor, I couldn't learn well! This is not a strange phenomenon, but a common one - look at the actual situation, it's quite common for teachers' children to perform poorly in school; and, the subject the children struggle with is likely the one taught by their parents.

The possibility is this: teachers exhaust all their patience on their students, so when they get home, they unconsciously lose patience with their own children. This is what happened to me. When I was young, my father also tried to teach me English, but after a few sentences, he would slap me, "So stupid, are you my son?" I was also stubborn, "Didn't you say I was picked up! Hmph!" Then we would part on bad terms.

However, one day, the inevitable finally happened.

In college, after much effort, I finally got a copy of "Animal Farm" with English-French contrast (not "Chinese-English contrast"). This book by George Orwell was a banned book during my growing years. Humans are strange creatures, if this book is readily available, you might not want to read it; but if it's a banned book, you have endless motivation to get it.

This book is hailed as the greatest political prophecy of the last century. The thin booklet tells a seemingly plain but earth-shattering story:

> In a farm, an old pig took advantage of the drunk farmer's absence, gathered all the animals in the barn, and held a meeting for everyone.

> The old pig climbed up the grain pile tremblingly and said, "I had a dream......"

> Before he could say a few words, Farmer Jones came back drunk, and everyone scattered afterwards.

> The next day, the old pig died. Everyone couldn't remember exactly what he said, but they felt very excited whenever they thought about it, not knowing why......

> Pigs are the smartest of all animals. Not long after the old pig died, two pigs, one named Napoleon and the other named Snowball, led everyone to rebel, drove Jones away, occupied the farm themselves, and established the Animal Republic......

> These animals even have a manifesto: "All animals are born equal."

> Later on, the pigs discovered that wine tastes good. But the problem is, wine is not infinite, it's not enough to drink. So a pig suggested, "Only pigs can drink wine." But then there was a problem, the wall outside clearly says "All animals are born equal." So, after a full meal and drink, a pig went to the wall and brushed some more words.

> The next day, all the animals saw that the slogan on the wall had grown a little bit: "All animals are born equal, but some animals are more equal than others."
......

When I got this book, I had been looking for it for several years, so you can easily imagine how thirsty I was at that time. And the French contrasted with English didn't discourage me, because I knew how to use a dictionary - how useful it is to use a dictionary, this book will mention later. It took me about half a month to finish reading this book, but I didn't feel tired at all. I even finished it without realizing it - but in fact, that was half a month!
Many years later, thinking back on this matter, I know that the content of "Animal Farm" did not have a greater impact on me than another thing. After reading this book, a sentence flashed in my mind: "English, for me, means freedom."
The feeling of freedom is really good.

Perhaps for you, learning English is not for freedom, but no matter what it is, as long as you discover it, your motivation will be endless.

[^10]: Now this book is no longer a banned book, you can even find the full Chinese translated version of "Animal Farm" on the Sina Reading Channel.

## 9. Finding the True Use of English for You

The use of English should be very different for everyone. Even in the aspects of listening, speaking, reading, writing, and translating, the requirements between individuals may vary greatly.

However, no matter what, you must figure out where the real use of English lies for you?

Listening and reading are inputs, speaking and writing are outputs, and translation can never be mechanical - otherwise, Google Translate would have replaced human translation long ago. Translation, in fact, most of the work content is "recreation".

In fact, for everyone, input is likely to be much more important than output. Because output depends on input, you need to input enough information first, and after processing (thinking), you can get the output result. So, where does the output come from without input? Even the input itself has certain requirements, because if we compare the brain to a computer, we can apply that famous computer theory to the operation mechanism of the brain: "Garbage in, garbage out." What comes in is garbage, what goes out is garbage - turning waste into treasure is often just a legend...

I have always believed that most people don't need to be afraid of only learning "dumb English". In fact, the vast majority of people actually don't have many opportunities to speak English. Of course, I am not against speaking English, I am just stating a fact: for many people, it may be enough to be able to read English fluently.
There are many benefits to being able to read English fluently. The word "freedom" is basically the biggest summary. For example, we can directly read first-hand literature, instead of having to wait a long time to read the translated text that is actually full of errors. Translations are often unreliable because translation is really a very difficult job. Many times, it's not the translator's fault that the translation is unreliable, at least, at least some languages are simply untranslatable. If you can read English fluently, then when you read the translation, you will definitely laugh from time to time - many wrongly translated sentences, you can even restore the original English in your mind based on experience. Not relying on translation is a great relief. When your English reading proficiency reaches a certain level, you will naturally feel fortunate, that is a kind of priceless fortune. However, it's not that time yet, as for now, whether to believe it or not is up to you.

Another undisputed fact is that English is the language with the largest amount of scientific literature, and it surpasses all languages in this respect. So, once you need to consult scientific literature, you basically have to use English. For some specific groups of people, writing may be more important. I know many foreign media staff stationed in China are like this. Although they speak English quite fluently, they themselves know how key the ability to write is for them. Therefore, they will do everything possible to improve their retrieval ability, thinking ability, and writing ability. In order to obtain key information more quickly and accurately, they also have to spend a lot of time and energy to weave necessary interpersonal relationships... Don't mistakenly think that writing an article of a few thousand words only requires vocabulary and grammar knowledge.

I don't want to sing the opposite tune, I not only think that oral English ability is very important, but also deeply know how difficult it is to practice fluent oral English. Because I myself have spent a lot of time and taken many detours to be able to express myself normally.

The reason why oral English is difficult to learn is because it is an output, so it must be much more difficult than input. Effective output not only requires effective input but also effective processing (thinking), so from this point of view, practicing fluent oral English is more than eight times more difficult than practicing fluent reading...

However, no matter what, input is the foundation. The fundamental reason why many people cannot output is that they input too little. How little it is, they themselves are not clear. This sentence can be used in any field of learning: **It's not terrible to not know, what's terrible is not knowing "you don't know"**.


## 10. We've Been Too Easy on Ourselves...

In the past, not only did we not believe that we could learn and use English well, but more importantly, even when struggling, we set our standards too low, to the point of "learning foolishly" or being "taught foolishly".

Apart from the "vocabulary" (college entrance examination vocabulary outline) mentioned earlier, there is also the amount of reading. The texts in our junior high school English textbooks start from a few sentences per article, and ultimately each article does not exceed 500 words; each article in the high school English textbooks is just under 1000 words; the longest text in the college English intensive reading textbooks is just 2500 words. Their common feature is: students are required to finish reading and learning an article within a few days (at most one week).

If reading is compared to running, and our junior high school texts are compared to 100 meters, then after many years of "learning" English, many people gradually adapt to the longest distance of only about 2000 meters... Over the years, the habit of the longest reading volume being 2000 words has resulted in headaches after a while of reading English... In fact, when reading to 1000 words, the brain starts to say "Hold on a bit longer!" When it gets to 1500 words, it says "Hang in there!" When it gets to 1800 words, the brain keeps shouting "That's about it, just like this..."

But, how does a normal person use language? Let's look at our own use of our mother tongue:

> In elementary school, learning to read was not too painful. In fact, many children already knew quite a few words in kindergarten.

> After you graduated from junior high school, your Chinese reading ability had already reached this level: in the thirty minutes of taking the subway (or other transportation) to a certain place, you could probably flip through a "Reader" magazine from beginning to end. In this process, you can easily distinguish which articles are "boring, don't want to read", which articles are "Hmm! Seems good!" And after reading, you have already judged the quality of the article, if it's good, you will recommend it to your friends, and even retell the content of the article to your friends for the sake of recommendation...

> Of course, if you are a university graduate, after seven years of high-intensity reading accumulation after junior high school (in school, whether we like it or not, we have to read a lot), your reading ability has long climbed another step: most magazines and newspapers can be digested while you are waiting for the bus or in line, most novels can be finished in a few afternoons, and even for you, many professional books do not need "a semester"...

So, under normal circumstances, most normal people are "running a marathon" in the use of language every day, and it is effortless.

The key is that initially reading text might be a bit tiring (think about the process of us going to school with a dictionary when we were young). But soon, it will get better. After that, most people are actually "enjoying the text". Use it to get information, use it to entertain the spirit, use it to communicate, rather than "study language".

Now, comparing our learning process in English, we can only say that we have been too easy on ourselves in the past.
What we should do is to adapt to the "marathon" as quickly as possible, and then even if we "marathon" every day, we don't feel abnormal, and we should forget the initial pain as soon as possible, and focus on the main function of language: use English to get information, use English to communicate... **Anyway, just use it.**
