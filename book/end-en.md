# Afterword

This book, after several revisions, was nearing completion when I received a letter from a reader, Lin Shan (@bojia). To me, it was nothing short of a gift from heaven. Here is the full text of her letter:

<hr />
I am a retired athlete.

I started reading Mr. Xiaolai's blog in 2008. In two years, I went from almost zero foundation to achieving a score of 6.5 in IELTS and successfully applying for study abroadâ€”I'm going to the University of Edinburgh to pursue my postgraduate studies this September. People around me were very surprised, asking how I, who had never attended middle or high school, learned English. A few days ago, I invited Mr. Xiaolai for a meal to thank him in person. He was also very surprised and pleased. He told me to write down my process of learning English and some of my feelings for everyone's reference. Hence, this article came into being.

I joined the provincial team at the age of ten and began my career as a professional athlete. While other children went to school with their backpacks every day, my teammates and I spent 8 hours a day, 6 days a week, practicing on the court with our rackets. Six years later, due to my own circumstances and the environment in the team at the time, like many athletes, I did not achieve very good results. I chose to retire and go to university. I clearly remember when I made this choice, my coach poured cold water on me: "You think studying is easier than training? I guarantee you won't be able to keep up after a week."

I was also unsure at the time. After all, I hadn't studied for so many years, and my foundation was lacking, not just a little. Could I keep up with university directly? But compared to continuing training, I was more willing to change my environment and start over, so I applied to a sports institute.

Compared to the sports team, university was like heaven. There were no morning drills, no control from the coach, and of course, there was still a track field, but no one was forcing us to run long distances anymore. As is well known, there are very few people who really study in sports colleges. People like those in Tsinghua and Peking University who jump off buildings due to academic pressure do not exist in our school. Other schools have a "suicide rate" every year, while our school has an annual "kill rate" and "killed rate". I regretted not going to a comprehensive university, while at the same time, I let myself enjoy the comfortable days of muddling along in this environment. It wasn't until I started job hunting and writing resumes that I realized my undergraduate years were even more empty than my transcript. At that time, I really wished I could include my measurements and attach a 5-inch photo, just to make the resume fill up a page.

In my senior year, like many others, I saw studying abroad as my last straw. I enrolled in a TOEFL class at New Oriental, where Mr. Xiaolai was teaching writing. Honestly, I didn't understand anything in class. Looking back now, it was a pipe dream to think about taking the TOEFL. I started learning English in college, and there were only four semesters of English classes in college. The English teachers in college assumed that you had a certain grammatical foundation, which was like a book from heaven for someone like me who had zero foundation. So, I basically relied on cheat sheets for exams, and my grades were always hovering around the passing line. With this level, it was impossible to score 90 on the TOEFL in half a year, no matter what cram school I attended. As you can imagine, a TOEFL score of 59 shattered my last hope. I felt that my life was definitely over. I didn't have any cultural knowledge, basic knowledge, I hadn't studied math, physics, chemistry, geography, history at all; my only skill was to be a coach or a teacher, and the job market was very narrow. How could I compete with those kids who had been going to school since they were young? Which company would want a retired athlete with a well-developed body and a simple mind? I started to blame my parents, why did they send me to practice; I blamed the school, why didn't they provide me with a good learning environment; I blamed myself, why didn't I cherish my time and make up for my lack of cultural knowledge.

At that time, I saw a passage in Li Xuefeng's blog:

> Lack of patience is almost everyone's nature, and it is also a habit that the vast majority of people ultimately fail to correct. Many people suffer losses in all aspects of life because of their lack of patience, but they are unaware of it; the result of suffering losses everywhere is that they become more and more eager for success, and more and more lack patience - so they can only rush left and right in this vicious circle for their whole life, and finally end up with an unknown cause of death.

This was the perfect description of my state at the time. I felt that I was still young and had time to read for a master's degree. After completing my master's degree, I would have a wider range of choices when looking for a job, so I thought of studying in the UK. But the study abroad exam is based on strength, and my foreign language is so poor. So I think if I want to study abroad, I must improve my foreign language, and this time I must learn from my lessons and not be eager for quick success. Therefore, I discussed with my parents again about going abroad to study. My parents were still skeptical, after all, there was a precedent, so they asked me to pass the IELTS before I started applying for schools. I assured them that I would definitely pass this time, and I wanted to score 7 points and go to a good school. I thought that I had persisted through so much training and exhaustion before, as long as I have the patience to persist, I can definitely do it.

I started with Cambridge Intermediate English Grammar, insisting on doing it three times, first to cultivate patience, and second to make up for grammar. With the habit of recording time, I record my English learning time every day. Starting in July 2008, I completed 2 units every day, taking about 90 minutes. The second time it took about 60 minutes to complete two units, and the third time it was faster, averaging 30 minutes to complete, and another 30 minutes to read the example sentences. I require myself, no matter how tired or busy, to complete 2 units every day. Of course, there were interruptions in the middle, and I told myself that this was my last chance. If I give up, I have to start all over again, and I can't repeat the same mistakes. In order to brainwash myself, I copied many sentences from Li Xuefeng's articles into a notebook and read them several times every morning. In September 2008, I studied New Concept English II at New Oriental. In early March 2009, I finally finished the three Cambridge Intermediate Grammars, and then I signed up for New Concept III. In May 2009, when I finished New Three, I signed up for the IELTS in June, wanting to take a bare test first to see what level I am now. During this month, while reviewing New Three, I used the methods in Li Xuefeng's articles on how to improve reading speed to read old TOEFL articles; I used old TOEFL PART-C articles for follow-up training. At the beginning, I felt that these methods were too slow and too troublesome. Until the exam, I only read 5 reading articles and practiced 2 follow-up readings. The IELTS score in June was not ideal, with a reading score of 5.5, listening 6, speaking 6.5, writing 5, and a total score of 5.5. My goal at the time was to score 7 points, and 5.5 was far from the target.

At that time, I carefully recalled my training as an athlete, how each technique was honed. I found that these have a lot in common with learning English. The essentials of each technical action are not complicated. After the coach teaches the basic movements, what remains is a lot of repetition. In countless repetitions, correct the wrong actions, imitate the actions of excellent athletes and combine their own characteristics, and finally form their own actions. Similarly, applied to learning English. I have mastered the basic grammar, basic vocabulary, and learning methods, so what remains is a lot of application and practice. The most important thing is to understand what I can control and what I cannot control. During the game, weather, venue, audience, opponents, and results are all uncontrollable things. The only thing that can be controlled is myself. Whether I have done my best for every action, whether I have executed the established tactics, whether I have persisted when I am tired, these are what I can control. Similarly, the test questions are not what I can control, and the results are even more uncontrollable. So I still think about how many points I want to score, and I always pay attention to the machine template, which is nothing more than a waste of time and makes me more anxious.

After understanding, do what you should do.

I didn't sign up for any training classes before the exam. The IELTS score in October was 7 for both listening and reading, 6.5 for speaking, and 5.5 for writing, with a total score of 6.5. Although I didn't get the ideal score of 7, this score was already up to the application standard. I was very excited at that time, proving that I was no worse than those students who had been studying since childhood. My experience tells me that as long as a person has a firm belief and is not afraid of hard work, there is nothing that cannot be done. Some people always emphasize that others are exceptions to excuse their own lack of effort. How bitter is this process? How difficult is it? I didn't feel it. Perhaps this is also thanks to the training I received from a young age, enduring tedious training and obeying the coach's instructions.

Secondly, confidence comes from ability, and any ability is gained through diligent self-study, a very clear process of going from nothing to something. I went from zero English foundation to passing the IELTS, honing my self-learning ability bit by bit. This process of going from nothing to something, driven by ability, is what boosts my confidence. In this world, apart from your skills and abilities that truly belong to you, there is nothing that can coexist with you. These are the real driving forces for confidence.

Lastly, I hope my experience can provide some help to those who genuinely want to excel in English.
