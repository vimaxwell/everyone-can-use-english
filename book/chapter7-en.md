# Chapter 7: Close Reading

## 1. Dishonesty Will Surely Lead to Loss

One can be dishonest in life, but being dishonest in learning is extremely unprofitable. On this point, I consider myself to have gained an advantage. My parents have never been stingy about buying me books, so almost from the time I could remember, my main expense has been buying books, up until today. When I was eight or nine years old, my mother, following the policy implementation of my father's exoneration, stopped being a veterinarian and transferred to work in a university library - thus saving a lot of money for buying books at home. Growing up immersed in the library is indeed the luckiest thing in my life.

I have always been grateful to my mother for her attitude towards reading. When I was very young, I was once seen by my mother flipping through a book aimlessly. She asked, "What are you reading?"

"Just a book," I replied absentmindedly.

"With such flipping, what can you understand?" My mother seemed very casual.

I said, "This kind of book... just flipping through it is enough..."

My mother paused for a moment, came over, took the book from my hand, threw it on the table, and said word by word: "A book that's good enough to just flip through, why are you reading it? It's a waste of time."

I was stunned for a moment, but quickly understood my mother's meaning. This sentence was etched into my brain and I have never forgotten it. To read, one must read good books. To read good books, one cannot just flip through them. So, over the years, no matter what I read, as long as I determine that it is a book worth reading, I will read it closely, and often many times over. Later, I often told my students that a good book is not flipped through, it is read - closely read (of course, a more literary term is "studied").

## 2. Reading Good Books Must Be Slow

Reading must be slow, because only slow reading can allow for careful appreciation. Reading is different from rushing on a journey. For those in a hurry, almost only the destination means everything; if a person lingers on the scenery along the way or gets entangled in the encounters along the way, they may not be able to reach the destination or even go astray. However, reading is not like this. If reading is really like rushing on a journey, then isn't it best to open the book and read the last sentence directly?

Good books are as important as oxygen for some people. I once felt that good books were hard to find. I still clearly remember the extreme frustration twenty years ago when I learned that a great author named George Orwell had written a good book called "Animal Farm" but I couldn't find it anywhere (that book was banned at the time). In the blink of an eye, twenty years have passed, and the Internet has changed everything. As long as you can read English, you can find good books on the Internet that you can't finish reading.

You don't even need to attend any learning classes. Finding good books and studying them hard is the best, fastest, and most effective English learning method I can think of — especially in today's world where audiobooks are so abundant, because I firmly believe that reading aloud is the most fundamental means of acquiring all language skills.

Friends around me always feel that I read books very quickly, but in fact, I read books very slowly. I never "skim-read", because I feel that a book that can be "flipped through" is not worth reading. I always feel that "skim-reading" has only one use: to roughly judge the quality of the book in hand. After my twenties, I found that I even like to not miss a word when reading novels. When I encounter an author who is careful with words, the reading process is even more enjoyable. Although I don't like to be too careful when I write, appreciating others' meticulousness can easily make me feel that I am actually quite careful — I know in my heart that it is an illusion, but I also know that it is an interesting and harmless illusion.

The reason I read slowly, and enjoy doing so, is because the current environment affords me an opportunity for "extreme gossip". I always marvel at how "Google + Wikipedia + English = Almost Everything". When an author mentions a particular work or another author they admire, I can immediately find related information, dive in headfirst, and thoroughly explore it. When I saw George Cooper mention Hyman Minsky in "The Origin of Financial Crises: Central Banks, Credit Bubbles, and the Efficient Market Fallacy (Vintage)", I immediately searched Gigapedia and quickly found Hyman Minsky's "John Maynard Keynes" (this originally out-of-print book was reprinted by McGraw-Hill in April 2008 due to references by George Cooper and others). After digging into the gossip, I've already spent three to five hours, but I'm still not tired of it.

Another important reason why I read slowly is because I take notes in a very verbose way. Years of experience have made me no longer trust my memory. As the saying goes, "a bad pen is better than a good memory", and I say, "when taking notes, always use Google". Extracting the original text no longer requires effort (thanks to the great Copy/Paste), writing annotations, or even writing an entire article, adding classification keywords (for future searches), all take a considerable amount of time. But this time is well spent. Those who don't take notes can't understand the rationality of this time and energy expenditure, just as those who don't succeed never understand the principle of attention to detail.

Reading a good book once is not enough. The greatest surprise in reading often comes from the "accidental" discoveries in repeated readings. Reading stimulates thinking, and thinking, in turn, changes the quality of reading. The two complement each other, coexist but never conflict. In this process, you can almost clearly feel the secretion of dopamine. No wonder ancient Chinese people said, "There are beauties in the book," and foreigners say, "Reading is better than sex."

## 3. Why People Dislike Close Reading

The original intention and sequence of educational designers for the cultivation of reading ability might be like this:

1. First, learn to recognize characters and recognize enough characters (obviously, the commonly used three thousand Chinese characters are not enough - for those who are pursuing knowledge);
2. Acquire a sufficient amount of vocabulary;
3. Learn more and more complex concepts - each important concept requires a lot of space to explain;
4. At the same time, acquire basic logical application abilities to more effectively understand and organize known concepts and their related information;
5. Through continuous close reading, acquire more concepts and ideas;
6. Through a large amount of extensive reading, expand and supplement your own concepts and ideas;
7. Through practice, re-understand important concepts and correct the understanding of important ideas;
8. Close reading and extensive reading complement each other, interactively used...

However, for various reasons, the most important of which is that education itself is a process that is too difficult and even difficult to succeed, every link in this process may go wrong.

First of all, many people actually have not recognized enough characters (in fact, for those who are constantly pursuing knowledge, it is quite embarrassing to only recognize but not use); secondly, many people have not acquired enough vocabulary - especially those that seem simple but can form various logical traps at any time (such as "all", "any", "either ... or ..." etc.); what is more terrifying is not which link has gone wrong, but that there are more or less defects in every link.

Often, an entire distorted worldview is rooted in the lack or misinterpretation of just one or two concepts - such as "double-blind tests" or "Stockholm Syndrome". And yet, logic, which is actually quite simple, is something many people never understand in their lifetime. The fear of making mistakes and consequently the fear of facing severe punishment is the sole reason why most people ultimately fail to master logical thinking. Education sometimes has to rely on "compulsion", causing "fear" to occupy the minds of many people, making it impossible for them to ever escape its shadow.

In a sense, many people have never had the ability to "read intensively" - they don't know enough characters, their vocabulary is not large enough, they don't have a rich enough concept volume, their logic is not rigorous enough... In a word, they are not qualified for "intensive reading". However, people always assume that their abilities will increase automatically with age. Therefore, an assumption that cannot stand on its own begins to appear extremely natural: everyone assumes after graduating from school that they know enough characters, have a large enough vocabulary, a rich enough concept volume, and a rigorous and powerful logical thinking ability... The most fatal thing is that they arrogantly believe that they no longer need "intensive reading" - that is something primary and secondary school students are forced to do - "extensive reading" is the activity that matches their age...

They are like investors in the stock market who mess around, sometimes making a bit of money, or even a fortune, by luck, increasingly believing that their success is not accidental - thinking in their hearts "I have a history, this feeling is particularly strong when I walk among the masses..." But as long as time is long enough (the greatest utility of people living longer and longer is that some illusions will eventually have to face reality), the higher they climb, the worse they fall - and afterwards, there is no chance to start over.

The "skimming" ability of those who have methodically and solidly progressed to the final stage is fundamentally different from what most people perceive as "skimming". The former, although "skimming" in reading, possesses the ability to "not miss any important information", and often can even "read between the lines". The latter is truly "superficial", never having obtained complete information, and in the fragmented information full of holes, they obtain their own unique illusions (without realizing it).

After reaching a certain age, it is almost impossible to re-cultivate one's "intensive reading" ability, because too many incorrect "patterns" have been formed, and various kinds of wrong understandings have long been intertwined and complicated, making it impossible to sort out any clues. What a pity.

## 4. Why can't I get the questions right even though I've read everything?

After graduating from high school, there is no need to take Chinese exams anymore. Therefore, many people start to mistakenly think that their language and literacy skills are good enough - little do they know that this is just because they no longer take exams, so their shortcomings are not exposed. When they get to university, many people no longer take Chinese exams, but they must take English exams (which are still language exams, but in a foreign language), and they start to encounter an extremely annoying embarrassment:

> Why can't I get the questions right even though I've read the whole article?!

I have taught TOEFL reading for many years. At first, I also found it strange, how could these students make such intuitive mistakes under the premise of understanding the article? It took me about two or three years to fully understand that the so-called "understanding" is just an illusion of these students who got the questions wrong.

How does this illusion come about? I've looked through many documents outside the field of English, and finally found the answer in psychological literature.

It turns out that the human brain has a special and powerful function called "Pattern Recognition". For example, we can quickly identify a specific person in a group photo, even if the person in the photo may look very different from now (for example, 20 years younger). At such times, we are using our pattern recognition ability.

Humans rely too much on this ability, so much so that pattern recognition also has a fuzzy processing variant called "Pattern Splicing". When we are dealing with fragmented information, we will involuntarily splice them according to some pattern we have encountered before - and always in a way that we think is meaningful.
Sometimes, we will use this function subconsciously. For example, you lie in bed, staring at the ceiling in a daze. After a while, the brain's pattern recognition function begins to automatically start: the originally unrelated and meaningless spots and textures on the ceiling begin to become "meaningful", for example, you seem to see a face, or other patterns...

![](images/figure56.png)

-- Devil's face in the smoke. A famous photo on 9-11 attack.

The above photograph, taken at the scene of the 2001 9/11 terrorist attack in the United States, has been widely circulated on the internet. People saw a "lifelike" face of Satan in the smoke that filled the sky after the Twin Towers were hit.

The question is, if a person has never seen the face of Satan anywhere or at any time before this, no matter how much the shape of the smoke resembles Satan or is exactly like Satan (assuming Satan really exists), this person could not possibly recognize it - because they have never seen Satan before!

A reasonable explanation is that people had seen the face of Satan in many places before this - in dramas, movies, animations, illustrations, etc. So when they saw the originally meaningless shape of the smoke, they quickly called up the "pattern" (Pattern) stored in their brains and used it to "understand" what they saw at the time - so, they "saw" the non-existent face of Satan.

This explains why so many students who got the questions wrong (in fact, those questions are very intuitive, as long as you really understand the article, you can't get the questions wrong) firmly believe that they understood the article. In fact, they did not understand at all, they could only understand some parts of the article, and there were other parts that they did not understand. However, the parts they did understand were like the originally meaningless spots on the ceiling, which became seemingly meaningful patterns after these students unconsciously activated their "pattern splicing" ability - in fact, they were calling up some patterns that these students had stored in the past; and these patterns were irrelevant to the actual content of the article they were reading, or even completely opposite. So, they "felt they understood the article", but what they actually saw was "something else that only God knows what", how could they possibly get the questions right under such circumstances?!

## 5. The Method of Close Reading

There is a bit of a method to reading articles, and this is even more so for reading articles in exams (TOEFL/IELTS/SAT/GRE/GMAT). But rest assured, truly effective methods are always very simple. (The following text is a bit abstract, but perhaps this in itself is a good reading material...)

When we read the first sentence (marked as S1), there is only one task, "What is this sentence saying?" (What does S1 mean? represented as M1) In fact, sometimes, this is not a simple task. It requires two things to support: 1) grammatical knowledge; 2) conceptual system. However, many people mistakenly think that only words are enough.

However, when we read the second sentence (S2), there is an additional task: not only to figure out M2, but also to figure out the relationship between M1 and M2 (marked as R1&2) —— this is something that many people never do.

The relationship between M1 and M2 can be roughly divided into two types:

1. M1 is supported by M2. At this time, M2 may explain M1 from one of three angles (or a combination of three angles) —— What? (Examples, elaboration) Why? (Cause and effect, comparison, classification, purpose) How? (Method, means, steps)
2. M1 and M2 jointly support another sentence. At this time, the possible relationships between M1 and M2 are: parallel, progressive, and transitional.

If M1, M2, and R1~2 are all known, then it means that the real "reading comprehension" has been completely accomplished.

However, in exams, candidates often encounter the following situations:

1. M1 is unknown, M2 is known, R1~2 is known;
2. M1 is known, M2 is unknown, R1~2 is known;
3. M1 is known, M2 is known, R1~2 is unknown;

This is no different from simple mathematics (just like "x+y=z") - in an equation with three variables, if two are known, it is easy to derive the value of the third variable. If all three variables are known, then it's not really an exam.

You should know that in a rigorously designed reading comprehension exam, there will not be a situation where there are three variables in an equation and yet two are unknown - that's not called an exam, that's called "making things difficult". This is why I always advise candidates not to easily believe in any "mock exams" - anyway, all the non-ETS official questions I have studied are generally not rigorous, not scientific, no matter how authoritative the authors and publishers are - don't believe it, anyone can use the simple principle just mentioned to make their own judgment.

The same principle applies to the relationship between paragraphs. Not only should you be able to summarize the main idea of the first paragraph (marked as MP1), but you should also summarize the main idea of the second paragraph (marked as MP2), and finally, you must clarify the relationship between the two paragraphs (marked as RP1~2) - this is something that even more people adamantly refuse to do - and then it's back to solving equations...

The principles are clear now (sometimes I wonder how I became a so-called teacher with such simple cognition), and then comes the steps for daily practice.

1. Struggle to understand the exact meaning of each sentence. Use all means you can - look up dictionaries, grammar books, even Google. "Doing it yourself" is many times more effective than "paying someone else to do it for you" (for example, taking classes and listening to lectures).
2. Understand the relationship between each sentence and each paragraph. There is another task in dealing with paragraphs - summarizing.
3. Organize vocabulary. You should know that after reading an article, organizing vocabulary by yourself is much more efficient than memorizing vocabulary books - unfortunately, most people don't believe it.
4. Read it over and over again. As you read, you may discover many things that you didn't notice the first time.
5. Retell the article. Being able to retell the article you just read in writing or orally actually requires many comprehensive abilities: memory, logic, retelling, reorganization, re-understanding, and so on.
6. Develop the habit of reviewing after a few days.

(In fact, for any kind of exam, if you take the real questions and handle about 50 articles in this way, you will basically be invincible.)

Considering that most people learn English just to cope with exams, the above text is based on exam articles as examples. In fact, you can "taste" any text in this way, but the key points of "tasting" different types of articles are different. Read poetry to taste the artistic conception, read prose to taste the mood, read novels to taste the plot, read newspapers to taste reality. For learning and reading, you have to consider many things beyond reading and tasting, why the author writes this way, where is the good and bad of this writing, how should I write to be better... and so on.

## 6. Speed Reading Often Isn't Reliable

The various myths about "speed reading" on the market are actually very unreliable. I don't believe in the theory that changing the way the eyeballs move can improve reading speed, because the bottleneck of speed is not in the "input method", but in the "understanding ability". I also firmly do not believe that "speed reading" can be solved by a "cram school" - I believe that reading comprehension speed can only be improved through accumulation.

All kinds of speed reading theories have a common defect, they assume that all text is formatted - in fact, this is absolutely impossible. Only formatted data can be batch processed, which is a truth that every programmer understands. But the problem is that knowledge cannot be formatted, some are simple, some are complex, some are precisely because they are simple and difficult to understand and apply, and they are interrelated, with complex dependencies. Wanting to use a simple model to process all data is a foolish and delusional idea.

Accumulating reading volume is the only way to improve reading comprehension speed. People who read a lot read fast. Although it seems that people are more willing to believe the opposite of this sentence: that is "because they read fast, they read a lot".

Observe life. Those who only read until junior high school and never go to school again, read very slowly (regardless of whether they can understand), and also save money: a magazine that costs a few dollars can be read for several months. In comparison, college students read much faster, a magazine may be flipped through during the subway ride, and afterwards, they can retell the exciting content to friends. Why is there such a big difference? Because the difference in reading volume accumulation between the two is astonishing.

Psychologist Dr. Blachowicz's survey results can provide us with a clearer basis for understanding this principle:

> A fifth-grade student, if they can manage to read independently for 10 minutes a day, will read 622,000 more words per year than those children who do not read independently...

This data tells us that a fifth-grade child reads about 170 English words per minute. In fact, Chinese students can read more than 200 characters per minute when reading Chinese (because Chinese characters are monosyllabic, while English words often have more than one syllable).

If we calculate at a reading speed of 200 characters/minute, excluding elementary school, just three years of junior high school, each child's daily reading volume is about 15,000 characters (equivalent to only 75 minutes of reading). In other words, in junior high school, an ordinary student's total reading volume over three years will exceed 16 million characters - if we assume an average book has 200,000 characters, that's equivalent to 80 books.

By the time they reach high school, children who enjoy reading will see their reading volume grow beyond the imagination of ordinary people - their reading speed will naturally increase 2 to 3 times, and due to a significant increase in comprehension ability, they often do not need to "speed read", but rather "skim" to obtain more information. For example, if an author provides three examples to prove a point - reflected in three paragraphs, then people with comprehension ability will scan the first example, skip the other two examples, and continue reading the next chapter. At such times, their reading speed appears much faster than others. Therefore, under normal circumstances, students who have accumulated a large amount of reading volume in junior high school will increase their reading speed by about 10 times in high school. Calculating this way, throughout the three years of high school, children who enjoy reading will conservatively accumulate a reading volume of over 100 million characters during this period.

Just as pilots or car drivers would "objectively" emphasize their years of experience or mileage when boasting about their driving skills, the more a person accumulates reading volume, the stronger their reading comprehension ability becomes. This, in turn, increases their reading speed, making it easier to accumulate more reading volume, thereby forming a virtuous cycle.

Therefore, truly useful and meaningful speed reading ability is obtained through accumulation, not through some fresh, unreliable theories or money-making training classes.

## 7. Plant a Reading Seed for Yourself

People often say, "I am very interested in English," but rarely do they say, "The text is so beautiful!" Many people are interested in English but not in their mother tongue. This only shows that they do not understand the significance of text and are merely superficial utilitarians. All they see is "If English is good, the salary is high, there are many opportunities..." That's all. Otherwise, why wouldn't they be interested in Vietnamese or Burmese? Most people are like this, always wanting something they don't deserve - this is their nature and the root of their ultimate unhappiness. Of course, they call this inexplicable behavior "pursuit" and have a special and strong emotion for this word. The interest of superficial utilitarians in English is as boring as a person who doesn't understand engineering being interested in tools.

English is just a kind of text. In this regard, it is no better, more advanced, or more beautiful than other texts. Believing that one's mother tongue is the most beautiful language in the world is the most naive idea (too lazy to add one of them). The first time I became aware of this naivety was when I was in middle school. There was an article in the Chinese textbook called "The Last Lesson". The author, Daudet, passionately wrote, "French is the most beautiful language in the world!" But in another country (where the most widely used language on earth, Chinese, is used), the (Chinese) language teacher excitedly (and in some ways, evasively) recounted Daudet's patriotic passion, repeating over and over again Daudet's narrow-minded nationalist idiotic sentence "French is the most beautiful language in the world!" - Is there a more absurd scene than this? (Of course, Daudet, in that special era, having this (narrow) democratic sentiment, from another meaning, is more likely to be understood as "heroic"...)

Every language has its own inherent uniqueness and roots of unique beauty. Ultimately, language is used to express, record, and communicate thoughts. If there is anything truly beautiful or even more beautiful, it is thought, not the language itself. Beautiful thoughts, expressed in any language, are beautiful. They shine brilliantly in one language and radiate in another. In the movie [V for Vendetta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_(film)), the protagonist V, shot countless times but not dying, slowly approaches Creedy. Creedy's handgun is out of bullets, so he shouts in despair, "Why won't you die?!" V calmly says, "Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creedy. And ideas are bulletproof."

The first time I deeply appreciated the benefits of understanding a language was when I finally got to read [Animal Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm). This book was banned in my country many years ago. I often saw it mentioned in articles by some great people, but I couldn't find it anywhere, which was extremely painful. Finally, one day, I got a bilingual English-French edition of Animal Farm and read it all at once. Of course, I couldn't understand French at that time, and I had to constantly look up words in English. That so-called "at once" was about two weeks - the book is actually just a thin booklet. Animal Farm is hailed as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. The author, [George Orwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell), tells a chilling allegorical story with his ruthless pen.

> There was a farm in England. The owner of the farm was often drunk and did not know how to treat the animals on the farm. One day, when the owner was not there, an old pig gathered everyone in the barn for a meeting. It climbed onto the stage tremblingly and said to the animals below, "I had a dream......" Before it could finish, the farm owner came back, and the animals were frightened and quickly dispersed. The next day, the old pig died. But the speech of the old pig that day was deeply and stubbornly left in the minds of the animals, although most of the animals did not quite understand what the old pig was saying... Later one day, two pigs (pigs are the smartest of all animals), one called Snowball, and the other called Napoleon, led everyone to rebel, drove the farm owner out, occupied the farm, and established the Animal Republic... There were many other animals on the farm, such as ducks who agreed with whatever anyone said, chickens who selflessly dedicated their eggs, dogs who played the role of police, a horse named Boxer who was the leader and was diligent and low in intelligence, a little mare named Mollie who only liked ribbons, an old donkey named Benjamin who was cynical and looked down on everything, and a crow named Moses who spoke unpleasantly... The Animal Republic had seven commandments, the last one was "All animals are equal."

> One day, long after reading this book, I suddenly realized that understanding another language is like having an extra piece of sky. English for me is no longer just about "learning", but about using it to gain freedom, even if it is just spiritual freedom - after all, what is more precious than spiritual freedom?

In a certain sense, I have always been grateful to the person (or "those" people I will never know) who banned Animal Farm. If they had not set up such a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, I might never have had this special experience. Later on, one day I heard Dr. [Randy Pausch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch) say in his "The Last Lecture", "The brick walls are there for a reason. They're not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something..." —— Instantly, I was moved to tears.

## 8. Only Humans Are Good at Reading

It is precisely because humans have language that they are fundamentally different from other species. And reading, for any normal human, has extraordinary significance. Species other than humans can only rely on the most primitive but magical way to accumulate experience: genetic inheritance. Terry Burnham and Jay Phelan mentioned in their book MEAN GENE that woodpeckers can instinctively use the optimal algorithm to obtain food —— but an MIT mathematics PhD facing the same problem may not be able to solve it quickly; so how does a woodpecker's small brain get the result without having received higher education? The answer is: through genetic inheritance.

Humans, of course, can accumulate experience through genetic inheritance. Infants, despite never having seen a snake, will cry hysterically at the sight of one; they have not seen a gun, yet they are not afraid of this object, which is far more terrifying than a snake — humans have been bitten by snakes countless times over generations; however, people have only recognized the danger of guns for less than two hundred years, and there has not been enough time to form a "natural" fear that can be inherited genetically.

The emergence of written language distinguishes humans from other animals. The advent of writing means that human experience accumulation no longer solely relies on genetic inheritance. Humans began to use writing to record and accumulate information, acquire knowledge, and disseminate experience... The information explosion has put us in the most astonishing era of human history, where the phrase "changing with each passing day" is no longer sufficient — "changing every minute and second" is not an exaggeration.

After humans finally acquired written language, they did not immediately reap the benefits. The dissemination and accumulation of knowledge did not suddenly become too easy. From knotting ropes to record events, to carving praises in stone, from bamboo slips recording crimes to silk scrolls for discussion, from paper recording history to leather for storing maps, the medium of writing has never been easy to preserve or disseminate. The novel "Journey to the West" vividly tells a story: in an era when the dissemination of written language was extremely difficult, how hard it was to acquire knowledge.

However, today, the ease of text dissemination has reached an unprecedented height. It can be said that the Internet has changed everything. Word processing software, blog engines, microblogs (like Twitter), and search engines have made writing, recording experiential knowledge, dissemination, sharing, and retrieval easier than ever before. Anyone with a bit of common sense can "publish" their own "experience", "trial and error", "observation" in written form. Behind the simple and refreshing interface of the search engine is almost a cosmic level of information (the word "massive" is no longer sufficient). The spirit of knowledge sharing has been promoted to an unprecedented extent, the most direct and most significant product of which is the free Wikipedia. Today, as long as one has sufficient reading ability, anyone can acquire "doctoral" level knowledge that was difficult to obtain in the past.

In such an era, "reading" breaks through the limitations of individual "experience" or mere "trial and error". "Experience" is often confined to oneself, and "trial and error" is limited to one's own experiences. However, through "reading", we can learn about others' "experiences" and the results of their "trials and errors" (i.e., so-called "experience"). We can transcend time and space, not to mention race and nationality - text translation tools are becoming more advanced, and the number of people mastering two or more languages is constantly increasing.

The premise of "reading" is that the experiences of predecessors recorded in text already exist. And text makes rapid accumulation of experience possible - "fear of snakes (reptiles)" might take hundreds of generations to become "innate knowledge" through genetic memory, but with the advent of text, within a single generation, it is possible to accumulate and acquire knowledge that has been accumulated over thousands of years. Modern people only need to spend about fifteen years in total in elementary school, middle school, and university, and they have the opportunity to encompass all the knowledge possessed by historical giants such as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, or Darwin, Mendeleev, and even Einstein in their own minds.

Text is too important. However, another obvious fact is that it seems impossible and has not been achieved to "educate" another Copernicus, another Galileo, another Newton, or another Darwin, another Mendeleev, or even another Einstein in about fifteen years of elementary school, middle school, and university. Clearly, there should be more important methods of acquiring knowledge, the difficulty of its use and teaching is so high that even the "formal education" system carefully designed by generations of elites often ends in failure.

After mastering a second language (or even more languages), another sky opens up. English currently has the largest and highest quality library of information on Earth, and the emergence of Wikipedia has further strengthened the status of English in this regard. Although sometimes, some English books have corresponding Chinese translations, reading translated versions can sometimes be a headache and unsatisfactory because:

1. The quality of the translation is poor;
2. The translation may have been censored;
3. The translation is inevitably too late...

Some people may think that reading translations saves time. However, from another perspective, learning a second language is the real way to save time and improve efficiency. Learning a second language is not as difficult as those who have failed imagine, on the contrary, it may be very simple. The reason why these people think it's "so difficult" is simply because they have never succeeded in this area. Those who do well also know the difficulties, and they really know how difficult it is, but they don't seem to be afraid of difficulties. Actually, that's right, think about it, what's not difficult? What's the use of being afraid?

## 9. How to Own a Private Library Like Professor Umberto Eco's or Even Better

Since ancient times, if you want to read, your family must be wealthy enough. Think about it, you don't have to work in the fields all year round, and you still have food to eat, is this a condition that ordinary people can have? We read ancient poems and see Ma Zhiyuan (about 1250~1324) lamenting "Old vines, old trees, crows at dusk, small bridges, flowing water, people's homes, ancient roads, west wind, thin horses, the sun sets in the west, and the heartbroken people are at the end of the world." It's so desolate. But if you think about it, whether it's thin or not, after all, he still has a horse (how many people have cars today?), followed by a book boy (how many people can afford a private secretary today?), paper, ink, pen, inkstone, the four treasures of the study (how expensive things are called "treasures"? The actual cost price may be much higher than the laptop that only up to 1/3 of people can carry with them today...), they need to carry with them... Many families do not have a rich family, accidentally produced a scholar, the family that has been saved by several generations has been "defeated" by him. Ma Zhiyuan's official career was not smooth, and he later lived in seclusion in Hangzhou.

Historical records often state that Zhou Yongnian (1730-1791) of the Qing Dynasty came from a humble background. I beg to differ. This man had a deep love for books and would acquire any book he saw. This is not a habit that a poor person could cultivate. The historical records also mention that his official career was fraught with hardship, which is quite believable, as he even pawned his winter clothes to buy books. Zhou Yongnian was fortunate enough to pass the imperial examination at the age of forty-one, and two years later, he was promoted to the Hanlin Academy as an imperial scholar. Later, he had the opportunity to assist Ji Yun in compiling the "Complete Library in Four Sections". Although he never became rich or powerful in his lifetime, he never lacked intellectual nourishment...

At the end of the seventeenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth century, there was a philosopher in France, [Pierre Daniel Huet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Daniel_Huet), who was considered the most erudite person of his time. It is said that in order not to waste time, he hired a literate servant who always carried books with him and read to him whenever he had free time - such as during meals, in the restroom, or while waiting for someone in someone's living room (I guess this servant was more learned than most people). It wasn't until about two hundred years later that the majority of people had the opportunity and financial ability to purchase a portable mp3 player to listen to audiobooks at any time... So, by the age of twenty, he was already considered the most promising scholar of his time.

[Umberto Eco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco), a professor and perhaps one of the most learned people in the world today (by the way, he is also a fan of 007 Bond), owns a private library with as many as thirty thousand books - with his profound knowledge, his book selection must be top-notch, so those are thirty thousand quality books. He despises those who ask him, "Wow! Umberto Eco, how many of these books have you actually read?" - because he believes that collecting books is not for showing off one's status, and more profoundly, he believes that unread books are more important and more valuable than read ones.

For most people, reading is essentially a luxurious hobby. When considering the cost of time and energy, reading is far more expensive than drug addiction - on the other hand, drug addiction can significantly shorten life, while reading basically does not have this side effect. Therefore, the cumulative cost of reading undoubtedly exceeds drug addiction by more than one order of magnitude. Just imagine that the total price of these 30,000 books alone will not be less than 1 million dollars...

However, the internet has changed everything. Below, I will tell readers a method to build their own digital library. Readers only need a computer (with a cost of only a few thousand dollars), an internet connection, and they can have a private library with unlimited capacity, small footprint, less money, low cost, and high efficiency - because it is a collection of e-books, so you can also do full-text search, which is a benefit that Ma Zhiyuan, Zhou Yongnian, and Pierre Daniel Huet dare not imagine and have never experienced. Umberto Eco looks down on those who ask him "Wow! Umberto Eco, how many of these books have you actually read?" - because he believes that unread books are more important than read books and have immeasurable value. And finally, we now have the opportunity to build a huge library for ourselves that we can't finish reading but can search at any time!

Since the launch of Windows Vista, Windows has built-in a fully-fledged, high-performance, user-friendly, and easy-to-use "indexing service". And on the newly launched Windows 7, the performance of the indexing service is even more satisfactory - especially when it is used to search for your own e-books.

Because PDF is the most commonly used e-book format, you should download and install Acrobat Reader on your computer.

First, make sure that the "Indexing Service" has been enabled on Windows: select "Control Panel"> "Programs"> "Programs and Features"> "Turn Windows features on or off".

Another method is: press the "Windows key" first, then enter "Turn on or off Windows features"; in fact, as long as you enter the words "Turn on or", you can already see the link to "Turn on or off Windows features" in the Windows "Start menu":

![](images/figure57.png)

By default, the Indexing Service was not checked before, now check it, and then press the OK button.

![](images/figure58.png)

Then you need to configure the "Indexing Options". Find "Indexing Options" in the control panel and click, the "Indexing Options" dialog box will pop up:

![](images/figure59.png)

Click the "Advanced" button in the dialog box to start configuring advanced options: 1) Remove the check mark before "Treat similar words with different pronunciation marks as different words (T)". Because we use English e-books for indexing, we don't want the computer to treat "resume" and "resumè" as two words. 2) Then click the "Select New Location" button to change the location where the Windows Indexing Service generates the database. The picture below was taken in a virtual machine, so it shows "C:\eLibrary Index Files". In fact, I use a separate hard drive (or at least a separate partition) to store e-books. There are only three directories under that hard drive: "x:\eLibrary" (used to store pdf, html, doc, rtf, txt and other e-books), "x:\eLibrary Index Files" (used to store index files), and "Audios and Videos" (used to store audiobooks and video lectures).

Next, you'll need to configure the file types that the indexing service will index. By default, all types registered in Windows will be indexed. However, we only need it to index a few specific file types in a directory, including: doc, docs, rtf, txt, html, and pdf...

Additionally, under "How should this file be indexed?", select "Add index to properties and file content (C)" - so that we can perform "full-text search" on the books in our library in the future.

![](images/figure61.png)

Now we need to select the "Index Location". Before doing this, we need to modify the folder display options in Windows. Click on "Computer" in the start menu, press the "Alt" key, and you'll see the menu bar. Select "Tools" -> "Folder Options", then in the "View" tab, find "Hidden files and folders", and select the second option: "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".

![](images/figure62.png)

Now, return to the "Indexing Options" dialog box, click the "Modify (M)" button. Then, in the "Index Locations" dialog box, select the "eLibrary" directory.

![](images/figure63.png)

After such configuration, Windows will index all the e-books in the "eLibrary" directory when the computer is idle. In the future, you can put new e-books into the "eLibrary" directory at any time, and Windows will automatically update the index database.

When you want to find something in your own library, you just need to use the "Explorer" to find the directory where the e-books are stored, and then fill in the keywords you want to search in the search input box in the upper right corner to see the search results. A quicker method is to press the Windows key and then directly input the string you want to search.

## 5.8 Easily Search E-books

About twenty years ago, the only way to obtain a large amount of valid information was to go to the library; and in China, libraries were a privilege of big cities. The Internet has changed everything, and electronic documents have long left paper media far behind in some sense. This is even more so in the English-speaking world.

There are several common search methods:

### 1. Directly search the book title or author name on Google.

Some authors may directly provide full-text downloads. For example, Nobel laureate in economics Milton Friedman's "[Free to Choose](http://www.freetochoose.net/)" not only has text, but also 15 episodes of video produced by PBS. The author of "The Selfish Gene"; Richard Dawkins' personal website provides downloads of most of his works.

### 2. Specify File Format in Google Search

The most commonly used formats for e-books include the following: chm, pdf, djvu. The chm format does not require a special reader, pdf requires the installation of Adobe Reader; and djvu also has its own reader. Often, these e-books on the internet are compressed into rar, zip, or other formats; it's best to install a WinRAR or 7-Zip decompression program.

When searching, enter the author's name or book title in Google's input box, followed by "filetype:pdf". For example:

> Tipping Point filetype:pdf

In short, the file types you can try are: chm, pdf, djvu, doc, rtf, txt, rar, zip...

### 3. Check Google Books for a Directly Viewable Version

Google Books does an excellent job, and the access address is http://books.google.com/. Many books can be read directly online; even if there is no "Preview" for a book, it still provides a search function.

### 4. Simply Customize a Dedicated Search Engine

Google's Custom Search Engine ([Google CSE](http://www.google.com/cse/)) function is very powerful. I have specifically created a CSE for searching e-books, which can be found on this page: http://is.gd/6nUgW

### 5. Search for the Author and Book Title on Wikipedia

On Wikipedia, you can often find a wealth of related information. The more famous the author and the more popular the book, the more information you'll find. You can often follow the trail to discover more resources.

## 10. How to Collect Good Books

If good books are as vast as the ocean, then bad books are as boundless as space. Zhou Yongnian was known for his insatiable appetite for books because, in his era, publishing was difficult and distribution was not easy. Today, however, things are different. Publishing has become easier, and distribution has become more convenient. People often say that we live in an era of information explosion, but I beg to differ. If it were truly an explosion of useful information, we would be overjoyed. Exploded useful information is not only easy to find but also useful. In reality, what's more likely to explode is junk information. The advent of the internet, in a sense, has only accelerated the flow of information. Although there has been a noticeable increase in the creation of useful information, its utility remains limited from a current perspective. As a result, what benefits most from the increased speed of dissemination is junk information, useless information. Conversely, useful information has become unprecedentedly difficult to find and filter.

Therefore, spending time selecting books is not a waste of time at all. More importantly, this process is equivalent to improving the quality of your life. I personally have a certain degree of skepticism towards various time management techniques, and only believe that "doing the right thing in the right way" can make the most of our time. Reading requires time, and spending time is equivalent to spending life. As long as one is conscious, who would want to waste life needlessly?

Firstly, you can start with the author, buy books written by experts, and try to understand their views and thoughts. If you want to understand any discipline, you can first see what books the most famous people in that discipline have written. The most famous person may not necessarily be the best author, but overall, they are the most reliable. When I was studying macroeconomics, the first textbook I read was "International Economics: Theory and Policy" co-authored by MIT economics professor Paul Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld. This book was first published in 1998 and by 2008 it was already in its eighth edition. In the same year, Paul Krugman won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Reading a book written by such an author is relatively more reassuring - although it's not wrong to maintain a skeptical attitude at all times, it's indeed necessary. Later on, when I wanted to seriously read about psychology, the first book I chose was "What You Can Change and What You Can't: The Complete Guide to Successful Self-Improvement" by Martin E. P. Seligman, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

Sometimes, we need to understand a field that we have no prior knowledge of. At such times, we may hardly know who the experts are in that field. There is another method for that, starting with the edition. Generally speaking, I only buy books that are in their second edition or later. Around 1997, when I was in my mid-twenties, I suddenly realized one day that I lacked sufficient logical thinking ability, so I had to run to the library to find answers. Starting with the word "thinking", I found that many book titles had "critical thinking" as a keyword - I didn't even know there was such a phrase before that (which shows how ignorant I was). So, among a large number of books with "critical thinking" in their titles, I chose a book that was first published five or six years ago and had been reprinted four times, "Beyond Feelings: A Guide to Critical Thinking", by Vincent Ruggiero. This book was released in its eighth edition in 2007. It's not an exaggeration to say that this book was the starting point of my rebirth. Even today, I will occasionally take out this book and flip through it. After reading this book over and over again, I found a bunch of related good books, so I kept having the chance to feel secretly pleased...

I discovered Professor Joseph M. Williams in the same way. When I needed it, I found his book, Style: Ten Lessons In Clarity and Grace, which was first published in 1981 and was in its sixth edition by 2000 (the ninth edition was released in 2006). I then bought several of his books in one go: Style: Toward Clarity and Grace, The Craft of Argument (I bought the first edition of this book, and the third edition was released in 2007), The Craft of Research.

Another treasure trove is the "references" section of good books. Foreign authors are very rigorous when writing books; they never hide the sources and basis of their ideas, all of which are clearly listed in the "references". The books referenced by such prominent figures are generally good books, and the authors of those referenced works are often top-tier experts. Books mentioned in the content of a good book, especially those given high praise, are certainly worth seeking out for a look.

In recent years, I've added two more criteria to my book selection: I prefer books that have electronic and audio versions. The best thing about electronic books is that they can be searched at any time, and listening to audiobooks is actually a great time-saver. You can listen anytime, anywhere, and a thick book, when read aloud in its entirety, is only a matter of twenty hours or so. Often, within a week or two, you can listen to it several times over, and the time used is just the time when you can't read while walking or taking a taxi, which is quite cost-effective.
