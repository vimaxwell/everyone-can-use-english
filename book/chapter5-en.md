# Chapter 5: Dictionaries

## 1. Embarking on the Journey Alone with a Dictionary

Using a dictionary, like reading aloud, is one of the most direct and effective ways to improve reading comprehension skills.

Suppose we encounter a sentence composed of 20 words, with one unfamiliar word. At this point, we should consult a dictionary rather than make wild guesses - even though sometimes we might guess correctly. Suppose after looking up in the dictionary, we find that this word has three meanings. What is our task then? - We need to understand the meaning of the known 19 words, and then determine "which of the three meanings of the unfamiliar word is the most appropriate and accurate when placed in the sentence?" Of course, more often than not, we're not that lucky. For instance, there are two unfamiliar words in the sentence. So we look them up in the dictionary and find that the first word has three meanings, and the second word has seven meanings. This means that we have to choose, and can only choose, one combination (that makes the current sentence coherent) out of 21 possibilities.

Isn't this the process of "reading comprehension"? What could be more conducive to honing our reading comprehension skills than frequent participation in the reading comprehension process? Sometimes I find it very strange why so many people (it seems at least over 90%) ignore the most effective and cost-free learning methods (reading aloud, using a dictionary), waste large chunks of time and a lot of money time and again, yet resolutely sign up for another so-called training class? It's not to say that all training classes are useless, but overall, even those useful ones ultimately have limited effects.

## 2. Death to Those Who Don't Use a Dictionary

Every organ in our body possesses a certain degree of "evolutionary capability" to a greater or lesser extent. Play the piano for a long time, and your fingers will become more flexible; persist in exercising, and your cardiorespiratory function will become stronger; speak more than others, and your tongue will be more agile... Among all our organs, the one with the strongest evolutionary capability is our brain. The brain's evolutionary capability is the strongest because it has the strongest adaptability, but precisely because of this, the evolutionary space of the brain may not necessarily be the largest. This statement seems a bit counterintuitive, but let's see what happens when adaptability is too strong.

> In the Amazon rainforest, there is a type of salamander that is a toy for scientists because this creature's adaptability is too strong: put it in a place without light, and it might degenerate its eyes within two days; if you then take it to a place with light, it will grow eyes within two days; throw it into the water, and it will degenerate its lungs and grow gills, take it out and put it on land, and it will degenerate its gills and grow lungs...

"Use it or lose it." This salamander's adaptability is so strong that it hasn't evolved at all for millions of years, because there's no need to evolve, because environmental changes mean nothing to it. In a certain sense, to put it vividly, the strength of our brain's adaptability is almost the same as this salamander, so it will "use it or lose it" to the greatest extent and at the fastest speed. This also explains why many people don't feel bad about "not making progress," because our brain will quickly adapt to the surrounding environment at the time - regardless of whether it is good or bad.

The greatest difference between an English teacher and a student might be just one thing: English teachers must consult dictionaries (and if there's anything else, it would be reference books like grammar books), while students have another choice besides looking up dictionaries — attending various courses. What does an English teacher do in class? Essentially, they are just explaining the words and phrases they looked up the night before, as well as the sentences they finally understood through consulting dictionaries (and other reference books) and thinking. And the students? They sit and listen. The students do listen, but fundamentally, they do not participate in the process of reading comprehension — a process that should involve frustration, confusion, helplessness, panic (which everyone dislikes) and sudden enlightenment (which everyone wants); thus, most students don't really think, and at most, they believe they have understood (in fact, without the preparation of the previous two states, one cannot see "that person standing in the dim light" when "suddenly looking back").

So many training courses are just like this: the English teacher's brain is rapidly evolving because they are constantly using it, and also earning money; while the students' brains are rapidly degenerating because they don't use them at all, and (once again) they are spending money. —— No one is doing this on purpose. This is also why I always tell students, "You must get rid of your dependence on teachers as soon as possible." You must be your own "enlightened teacher", otherwise, you will be a salamander for life —— and maybe even in the next life, because although intelligence may not necessarily be inherited, habits are almost certainly passed on to the next generation. For humans,

In fact, you don't need to consult a dictionary every day for the rest of your life - as you keep looking up words, there will come a time when you no longer need to, because you've mastered the vast majority of them. Remember when we were young and we all carried the "Xinhua Dictionary" to school? Of course, later on, it was the "Modern Chinese Dictionary" - surely no one had to carry them around every day after junior high school? The same goes for English dictionaries, sooner or later you'll put it on the bookshelf. It's just that for a recent period of time (two or three years?), you need it at your fingertips.

## 3. A little more care and patience can make you extraordinary

Looking up a dictionary is not difficult. But having a little more care and patience is not as easy as you might think. I have a classic example sentence to illustrate the point, which appeared in the reading section of the TOEFL exam:

> It was attempting to suggest that every disease and condition for which there had been no previous effective treatments might be responsive to vitamin therapies.

In fact, ETS never creates articles on its own, this sentence is a passage from the Child Psychiatry and Human Development magazine, 1998, issue 3, "Orthomolecular therapy: Its history and applicability to psychiatric disorders". The College Board, which designs the SAT exam, does the same - the reading articles in the SAT exam can almost always be found on the internet.

Perhaps readers would look up the meanings of "attempting," "responsive," or "therapy" in the dictionary, but among the students I've seen, hardly anyone checks what "condition" should mean in this sentence. The reason they didn't think to look up "condition" is because they "know" this word, "condition: n. condition, situation." However, even if they know all the vocabulary other than "condition," and fully understand the exact meaning of each word in the current sentence, doesn't this interpretation feel awkward?

What does "and" mean and how should it be used? Everyone knows, right? What comes before and after "and" should usually belong to the same category - this is basic logic. Now, in front of "and" is "disease," the meaning of this word is "disease," so should "every disease and condition" be "every disease and condition"? Or "every disease and situation"? - Actually, neither of them makes sense. As long as you think a little bit here, you will have doubts, and then it should be natural to open the dictionary to check "condition."

Check the dictionary and you'll know that the word "condition" has another meaning as a noun, which the dictionary says is "(colloquial) illness." Check the thesaurus and you'll know that "disease" is the most commonly used word to express "disease"; and "condition" is often used in colloquial language because "condition" usually refers to those not too serious diseases that are often contracted and therefore often mentioned. "She had a condition this morning." is equivalent to saying "She was a little uncomfortable this morning." So, "every disease and condition" is equivalent to saying "no matter big or small illness."

Here is the translation of the paragraphs in the second block:

A particularly classic example can be found on the Chinese internet, where thousands of search results turn up the translation: "Frying beef patties does not harm your dignity." The original sentence is: "Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping; they called it opportunity." I don't understand how the translator and the thousands of people who reposted this article couldn't see that this interpretation makes no sense. In fact, many people are like this, they only input without processing, and they don't even know that they haven't processed at all - they read (or even can't finish reading) but don't try to understand, so they don't understand, and they don't even know that they haven't understood.

If you look up the dictionary, you'll find that "flip burgers" is a phrase, which means "to do work that does not pay well, especially at a cheap restaurant. Instead of playing baseball, the boys might be flipping burgers and earning a little cash." So, that sentence should be understood (or translated) as: "Doing a job that pays a little less does not harm your dignity. Your grandparents had a different definition for such work; they called it an opportunity."

Taking things at face value is the biggest obstacle to reading comprehension, and it can even be considered a "condition" that could one day become a "disease". The root causes of taking things at face value are firstly laziness, secondly arrogance, and thirdly self-limitation, which is produced by being both lazy and arrogant, and is difficult to overcome precisely because of this combination.

There are many similar examples. The word "journeyman" has been misunderstood countless times in the Chinese world. Many years ago, a famous role-playing game called "Journeyman" was translated as "Wandering Hero". Eric Clapton's album "Journeyman" was once translated by domestic record companies as "The Trekker" - because the translator thought "journeyman" meant "a person who walks", and given the hardships Eric Clapton had gone through in those years, the translator creatively chose "trekking" instead of "traveling". In fact, "journeyman" means "a worker who has completed an apprenticeship, a skilled worker". A 20th Century Fox series "[Journeyman (2007)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948538)" was translated as "Time Traveler", which is barely acceptable because the story is about time travel, but it's not quite appropriate - because the title of the series is a pun, another meaning of "journeyman" is "a seasoned hand: a worker with experience and ability but is very ordinary", implying that the protagonist is very capable.

In 2008, there was a widely viewed internet film called "[Man from Earth (2007)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/)", which was translated into Chinese as "This Man Comes from Earth". This is also the result of not consulting a dictionary. If "Earth" is meant to represent "the earth", there should be a definite article "the" in front of it, so "earth" here definitely does not refer to "the earth", then what is it? Look up the dictionary and you'll find that "earth" has another meaning, which is "hole, cave". According to the plot, "Man from Earth" should roughly be equivalent to "Cave Man". As for what it should be translated into, it doesn't matter, anyway, it shouldn't be "This Man Comes from Earth".

In other fields, whether it's life or study, it's really not easy to want to be extraordinary. However, in the matter of learning English, as long as you are willing to pick up the dictionary, and then occasionally use your brain to find and solve problems, you can achieve "extraordinary" - alas, where else can you find such a good thing?

## 4. Mastering Phrases - The Advantages of Kingsoft PowerWord

The most basic unit of Chinese is "character", and multiple characters combined are called "word". But the basic unit of English is "**word**", which is translated into Chinese as "word", and the thing composed of multiple "**words**" is "**phrase**", which can only be translated into Chinese as "phrase".

When we use Chinese, we initially rely on a "dictionary". After learning the commonly used Chinese characters, we start to depend more on a "thesaurus". In the Chinese world, this is indeed the case, "at most we look up words" —— idioms (clichés), proverbs (not giving up until the last moment), allusions (no fish in clear water), terminologies (hydrogen ion concentration index), etc., all are "entries" in the "Modern Chinese Dictionary".

Because "word" is translated into "word" instead of "character" (it's really unclear who was so presumptuous to translate it this way. But it must have been "out of good intentions". This is another excellent example of "good intentions do not necessarily lead to good results"), Chinese students inadvertently equate the concept of English "word" with Chinese "word" in their minds, two concepts that are not equivalent. So when looking up an English dictionary, they feel "at most it's just looking up words", and never pay attention to those "words" that can be combined into "phrases". Perhaps this is why Chinese students always neglect to look up "phrasal verb dictionary" or "dictionary of idioms". In fact, most English dictionaries also contain enough explanations of phrasal verbs and idioms, but most students always think that as long as they recognize every word in a sentence, that's enough, so there are always gaps in understanding.

Take a look at this passage (this is another sentence from the TOEFL article that contains this vocabulary question):

> But this increased protection is partially counteracted by the fact that mass roosts attract predators and are especially vulnerable if they are on the ground. Even those in trees can be attacked by birds of prey.

Students might look up 'counteracted' (after which they'll regret "how did I not recognize such a simple compound word at first glance?"), as well as 'roost', 'predator', 'vulnerable', and 'prey'. Then they would feel they've "done their best". However, "birds of prey" are not what many people assume to be "birds that are preyed upon", but rather "carnivorous birds, birds of prey".

> If you haven't seen the explanation for "birds of prey" in the previous chapter "2.1 Reading Aloud Helps Improve Text Comprehension", and you didn't know the meaning of this phrase before, would you take the initiative to look it up in the dictionary?

Let's take a look at another passage (this is a sentence from a reading practice article in the Online Course provided by Collegeboard):

> I would rather take a chance with my personal vision of the truth making an impact here and there in the existing chaos of publication, than attempt to filter it through a few sets of official, honorable, and public-spirited scrutinizers.

One of my colleagues once translated this sentence as:

> I would rather take a risk, use my personal view of the truth to disturb families everywhere, in the chaos of already published materials, rather than have it filtered by a few respectable officials, who scrutinize with a sense of public duty.

This colleague of mine is a very serious person, other colleagues even think that he is sometimes neurotically serious. But this time he made a mistake. The phrase "striking home here and there" in this sentence is definitely not "disturbing families everywhere," because "strike home" is a phrase, which means "hit the nail on the head." He didn't look it up, so he made a "basic mistake."

"Kingsoft PowerWord" is likely one of the most widely used software products made in China, with perhaps only Tencent's QQ and a few download tools like Thunder ranking ahead of it. While there are many choices for IM tools besides QQ, such as MSN and GTALK, and download tools beyond Thunder, like FlashGet and BitComet, when it comes to English-Chinese dictionary software, "Kingsoft PowerWord" has virtually monopolized the market for the past decade.

This software, which has helped countless people, is actually a mess. Over the past ten years, it has continuously released new versions, but apart from the [increasing number of errors](http://is.gd/6eM6S), there is little to commend about its new features. In addition to textual errors, there are many other shortcomings, such as:

* Most of the word pronunciations are not by real people, but by Microsoft's machine engine, which is muddled and unclear, truly "gibberish". And while a few words are indeed pronounced by real people, it's unclear where these people were found to do the reading - they're neither standard nor pleasant to the ear - so they're completely useless.
* Phonetic notation includes AHD, D.J., and K.K., but there are countless errors, so it's basically unusable.
* It includes countless junk dictionaries. The only useful ones are: a) Concise English-Chinese Dictionary (with the most words and concise definitions) b) American Heritage Dictionary [Bilingual], you must use the bilingual version, because the Chinese definitions in the English-Chinese monolingual version are translated by who knows who, and are unbearable to look at.

Despite "Kingsoft PowerWord" never being a satisfactory product, it does have its merits. The most useful of these is its "automatic phrase recognition" - a feature that Kingsoft itself has never heavily promoted. Just look at the picture below to see what this feature is good for.

![](images/figure16.png)

One of the common frustrations when learning English is "I recognize every word, but I don't understand when they're put together..." But there's something even more terrifying, which is "I thought I understood, but I actually didn't..." —— I often say "It's not scary if you don't know, what's scary is if you don't know that you don't know." This is what I mean. For example, the phrase "purple passage", everyone recognizes "purple", everyone recognizes "passage", so, without a "smart" mouse dictionary like Kingsoft PowerWord (of course, the premise is that the text you're reading is electronic and not printed), most people might just fool themselves and completely unaware that "purple passage" is a phrase, and the meaning of this phrase is "a florid section of a literary work", not "a purple chapter".

The first time I was shocked by this feature of Kingsoft PowerWord was many years ago when I casually highlighted a passage with my mouse and found out that the meaning of "birds of prey" was actually "carnivorous birds, birds of prey", not what I had assumed to be "preyed upon birds" (which is the text mentioned at the beginning of this article. Later, when I was lecturing, I used this as an important example, and found out that the majority of students were just like me back then) —— That moment sent chills down my spine, and since then, I've developed the habit of frequently scanning over the articles I've read with my mouse; over the years, I've benefited immensely from this.

## 5. Transforming Word into a Powerful English Learning Tool

1. MS Word 2007's "Mouse-over Translation" Feature
2. MS Word 2007's "Dictionary Panel"
3. MS Word 2007's "Thesaurus"
4. MS Word 2007's "English Assistant"
5. Setting up Word Pronunciation Feature in MS Word 2007
6. Customizing Reading Vocabulary List with Word 2007
7. Appendix: My Frequently Used Macro Codes

In the era of knot recording, humans were not much different from other animals. It was only after the advent of written language that humans began to possess so-called "knowledge" that could be disseminated across generations, corrected, and accumulated. Therefore, writing tools are incredibly important to humans. From brushes, quill pens, pencils, fountain pens, ballpoint pens... to today's various input methods and word processing software (MS Word being one of them), every revolution in writing tools has been accompanied by tremendous human progress. For Chinese students, MS Word is not just a "word processing tool," but also a very powerful learning tool.

### 5.1 MS Word 2007's "Mouse-over Translation" Feature

Starting from the 2007 version, MS Word has embedded a "mouse-over translation" feature. The dictionary it uses is the authoritative English-Chinese version of the "American Heritage Dictionary," with detailed definitions and abundant example sentences. Under "default installation," the mouse-over translation feature is not set to open. It requires the user to manually activate it — select "Translate" from the right-click shortcut menu, and then select "Chinese (China)".

![](images/figure18.png)

From this point forward, whenever you hover your mouse over an English word, you will see its Chinese translation:

![](images/figure19.png)

### 5.2 The "Dictionary Panel" of MS Word 2007

By default, MS Word has a shortcut: "Alt + Left Mouse". Hold down the Alt key and then click on any English word with the left mouse button, and the sidebar of MS Word will display the search results for this word (this is equivalent to right-clicking on the English word and then selecting "Translate" -> "Translate" from the shortcut menu):

![](images/figure20.png)

If you have installed the Chinese version of MS Office, you may need to set it up so that you can automatically select the entire English word in the document by double-clicking the left mouse button ("Word Options" -> "Advanced" -> "Automatically select the entire word (W)"):

![](images/figure21.png)

This dictionary is bidirectional in English and Chinese. Select a Chinese vocabulary in the document, then use the "Alt + Left Mouse" shortcut in the selected area, and the right side will display the English definition of the Chinese vocabulary.

### 5.3 The "Thesaurus" of MS Word 2007

By right-clicking on any English word, you can see a "Synonyms" shortcut menu. You can replace the word in the document with a synonym by selecting a submenu item:

![](images/figure22.png)

If you want to see more comprehensive content from the "Thesaurus," move the cursor to the position of a word and press the "Shift + F7" shortcut key. You can then see detailed content from the "Thesaurus" in the right sidebar. MS Word also has a very convenient "Thesaurus Query Dialog," but many users have never seen it because there is no default shortcut key set for it:

![](images/figure23.png)

The method to add a shortcut key for the "Thesaurus Query Dialog" is as follows:
* "Word Options"->"Customize"->"Customize Keyboard Shortcuts";
* In the "Customize Keyboard" dialog box, select: "Specify Command"->"Category(C):" choose "All Commands"
* Choose ToolsThesaurus in "Command(O)",
* Click the left mouse button in the input box under "Press Shortcut Key(N)", then press "Ctrl+Shift+F7" at the same time, then click the "Assign" button in the lower left corner, and then close the dialog box. (Of course, readers can choose the combination of shortcut keys according to their preferences...)

![](images/figure24.png)

### 5.4 MS Word 2007's "English Assistant"

In fact, readers may have noticed that the best tool in the right sidebar dictionary should be the "English Assistant" (rather than the "Bilingual Dictionary" called out by the "Translate" command). The "English Assistant" includes almost all the good stuff: "Chinese Definition" (equivalent to an English-Chinese dictionary), "English Definition" (equivalent to an English-English dictionary), "Common Collocations" (equivalent to a collocation dictionary), and "Synonyms" (equivalent to a Thesaurus). So, how can you directly call out the "English Assistant"?

Actually, it's quite simple, the method is the same as the one mentioned above for "Adding a Shortcut Key to the Synonym Query Dialog Box". However, this time you need to add a shortcut key for the "EngWritingAssistant" command. I generally prefer to use "Alt+X", a keyboard combination that has not yet been defined in MS Word.

![](images/figure25.png)

Also, this "English Assistant" in MS Word must be connected to the internet to be used, because it actually returns the query results after querying Microsoft's server. The service query address is:

> http://office.microsoft.com/Research/query.asmx

Readers with programming capabilities might want to take a look at the "Basic Query Option"...

Some people's Office installation on their computers may not have the "English Assistant" service installed, and users need to manually add it. Right-click anywhere in the document while holding "Alt" to bring up the tool box on the right, then click on "Research Options" at the bottom of the tool box:

![](images/figure26.png)

Click on the "Add Services(A)" button in the lower left corner to get the following dialog box:

![](images/figure27.png)

Then, in the text input box after "Address(A)" at the bottom, enter: "http://office.microsoft.com/Research/query.asmx" and then press the "Add" button:

![](images/figure272.png)

Click the "Install(I)" button in this dialog box to complete the process.

### 5.5 Setting Up Word Pronunciation Function for MS Word 2007

This step is a bit more complicated because it involves adding macro code to Word.
In the Word program, close all documents first, then press the shortcut "Alt+F11" to bring up the VBA editor.
From the "Tools(T)" menu, select "References(R)", and in the dialog box that pops up, select "Microsoft Speech Object Library", then check the box in front of it.

![](images/figure28.png)

Next, in the VBA editor's left-hand "Project" panel, double-click to select "Normal - Microsoft Word Objects - ThisDocument". In the main program panel, enter the following VBA code:

```vba
Sub SpeakText()
    On Error Resume Next
    Set speech = New SpVoice
    Selection.MoveLeft Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1
    Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1, Extend:=wdExtend
    If Len(Selection.Text) > 1 Then
        speech.Speak Trim(Selection.Text), SVSFlagsAsync + SVSFPurgeBeforeSpeak
    End If
    Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1
    Do
        DoEvents

    vba
Loop Until speech.WaitUntilDone(10)
Set speech = Nothing
End Sub
```

After pressing the shortcut "CTRL+S" to save, close the VBA editor. Then, you can set a shortcut for this macro - I personally choose "CTRL+SHIFT+S".

![](images/figure29.png)

In fact, writing macro code for Word is very simple, and VBA program code is relatively easy to read. In the last part of the current document, I have added the macro code I use most often.

### 5.6 Customize Reading Article Vocabulary List with Word 2007

MS Word has a great feature: "Select Text with Similar Formatting (S)". In this way, when reading an English article, you can conveniently mark all the new words, and then you can use "Select Text with Similar Formatting (S)" to copy the text that has been marked separately.

![](images/figure30.png)

After selecting, press "Ctrl+C":

![](images/figure31.png)

Then, find another place and press "Ctrl+V", you can get the following list:

* neonatal
* burgeoning
* endoscopic
* snaking
* gallbladders
* jabbed
* sales pitch
* laparoscopic
* lickety-split

Using the same method mentioned before, you can also set a shortcut key for the "Select Similar Formatting (S)" command - the command name for this function is "SelectSimilarFormatting"; I usually set it to "Alt+S".

What kind of formatting should be used to mark the text while reading? "Bold" and "Italic" might not be good choices, as there might already be some text in these formats in the document; highlighting is also not a good choice, I don't know why Word's "Select Similar Formatting (S)" doesn't support this format. I usually use "Double Underline". Just like you can see in the illustration above. This time there's no need for customization, because Word has a default shortcut key for double underline "Ctrl+Shift+D".
The method to remove all marks is to click on a word that has been marked with a "Double Underline", then press the shortcut key "Alt+S" that we just set, and then press "Ctrl+Shift+D".

### 5.7 Appendix

Below is the macro code I commonly use:

vba
'To use this macro, you need to install the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary first
Sub LookUpMerriamWebsterDictionary()
'MWDictionary Macro
     Selection.MoveLeft Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1
     Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1, Extend:=wdExtend
     Selection.Copy
     Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1
     If Tasks.Exists("Merriam-Webster") = True Then
        With Tasks("Merriam-Webster")
            .Activate
            .WindowState = wdWindowStateNormal
        End With
         SendKeys "%ep{ENTER}", 1

     vba
Else
    Response = MsgBox("The Merriam-Webster task doesn't exist! Please run the application before using this Macro.", vbExclamation, "WARNING!")
End If
End Sub

Sub SpeakTheWord()
    On Error Resume Next
    Set speech = New SpVoice
    Selection.MoveLeft Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1
    Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1, Extend:=wdExtend
    If Len(Selection.Text) > 1 Then 'speak selection
        speech.Speak Trim(Selection.Text), _
        SVSFlagsAsync + SVSFPurgeBeforeSpeak

    vba
End If
Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1
Do
    DoEvents
Loop Until speech.WaitUntilDone(10)
Set speech = Nothing
End Sub

' Add double quotation marks to the selected text
Sub AddDoubleQuotationMarks()
    Selection.InsertBefore ("“")
    Selection.InsertAfter ("”")
    Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1
End Sub

' Specify the font of the selected text
Sub ChangeFontNameTo()
    Selection.Font.Name = "Georgia"
End Sub

' Specify the font size of the selected text
Sub ChangeFontSizeTo()
    Selection.Font.Size = 28
End Sub

' Enlarge the font size of the selected text
Sub FontSizeGrow()

End Sub

    vba
' Increase the font size of the selected text
Sub FontSizeGrow()
    Selection.Font.Grow
End Sub

' Decrease the font size of the selected text
Sub FontSizeShrink()
    Selection.Font.Shrink
End Sub

' Capitalize the first letter of the word where the double mark is located
Sub FirstLetterToUppercase()
    Selection.MoveLeft Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1
    Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdCharacter, Count:=1, Extend:=wdExtend
    Selection.Text = UCase(Selection.Text)
    Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdWord, Count:=1
End Sub
```

## 6. About Webster's Dictionary

There are many versions of Webster's Dictionary in the United States, such as the "Random House Webster Unabridged Dictionary". The "Webster's Dictionary" often mentioned by students in China refers to the "Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and Thesaurus".

![](images/figure32.png)

The authority of Merriam-Webster is essentially beyond doubt — in fact, there are many authoritative dictionaries, and they are all equally authoritative, such as Oxford, Cambridge, and even Microsoft's are all authoritative. However, Chinese students are often told that "The vocabulary of the GRE exam is mainly based on the American Webster's Collegiate Dictionary! According to statistics, most of the phrases used in the GRE antonyms are the original words in the Merriam-Webster dictionary." This is basically a case of passing on errors. Firstly, in the GRE exam of that year, there were almost no "phrase words" in the antonym questions (now the GRE exam has eliminated pure vocabulary questions). Secondly, when ETS designs the exam, it basically won't use the "original words" from any dictionary. In fact, the GRE exam has never taken any dictionary as the only reference.

There are currently two versions of the electronic version of Merriam-Webster that can be found online: version 2.5 and version 3.0. I personally think that version 3.0 does not have any truly meaningful improvements. Version 2.5 is relatively more useful. On emule, there are often many versions around 50M in size, don't use them. Firstly, the hard drives are very large now, and it's not worth saving a few hundred megabytes of space. Secondly, the reason why the 50M version is small in size is actually because it has removed one of the most important features of Merriam-Webster — "real person pronunciation". This dictionary is best installed on the computer in this way: copy all the files on the CD to a directory on the hard drive, and then start the installation from the hard drive (otherwise, if you want to listen to the real person pronunciation in the future, you will need the CD to always be in the CD drive).

The "real human pronunciation" feature of the electronic version of Merriam-Webster is, in my opinion, the best produced among all electronic dictionaries available — the pronunciation is the clearest (accuracy is a given), and the volume is the most stable. Phonetics has always been considered one of the significant challenges in learning English. However, with the "real human pronunciation" feature of the electronic dictionary, it doesn't matter if you don't understand phonetics. Moreover, too many printed "English-Chinese dictionaries" in China have numerous errors in phonetic notation, which can be misleading. For example, the word "recognize," where the syllable "co" is often pronounced as [ki]:

![](images/figure33.png)

Another example is the word "fortunate." Many English-Chinese dictionaries have added a vowel /ə/ — equivalent to adding an extra syllable!

![](images/figure34.png)

After querying any word in Merriam-Webster, if the entry is in blue font, it means that by double-clicking that blue word, you can hear the standard pronunciation.

In addition, Merriam-Webster also supports various search methods, which other dictionaries cannot do.

* Entry word is…
* Defining text contains…
* Rhymes with…
* Forms a crossword of…
* Is a cryptogram of…
* Is a jumble of…
* Homophones are…
* Etymology includes…
* Date is…
* Verbal illustration contains…
* Author quoted is…
* Function label is…
* Synonymy paragraph contains…
* Usage paragraph contains…
* Usage note contains…

Within Advanced Searches, you can also use "AND, OR, NOT" to construct more complex search expressions. And in Browse, you can search for "Entry Word starts with" and "Entry Word ends with"...

In addition, Merriam-Webster also has many pictorial explanations, such as the word sloth.

Click on the little eye icon, and you can see:

Finally, the most impressive feature of Merriam-Webster is its "Spelling Help". A common dilemma when looking up English words is that we only know the pronunciation of a word but not its spelling, so we can't find the word. However, with "Spelling Help", it's very convenient. For example, if I enter corisbondant, which is obviously not a word, "Spelling Help" will give me several possible suggestions based on the possible pronunciation of this string - under normal circumstances, we can find the word we need (in this case, it's correspondent). Kingsoft PowerWord also has a similar function, but it's not as comprehensive. (If you enter corisbondant in Kingsoft PowerWord, it will tell you: Sorry! There is no local explanation for this entry, you can choose the following methods: please query online, give similar spelling words, add to user dictionary)

## 7. Collins Cobuild - Lexicon on CD-ROM

The Collins English Dictionary is an essential dictionary for English learners.

Note: The version I recommend using is the third edition of this electronic dictionary, not the latest fifth edition. The fifth edition of Collins, aside from a fancier appearance, is almost worthless, with many of the practical features of the third edition being "cut". There are countless examples of software that becomes worse after an upgrade. After Office upgraded to 2007, its built-in dictionary content couldn't be "selected all"; Kingsoft Dictionary's versions after the 2005 edition "cut" its most useful feature "full-text search"; it's hard to see where the improvements are in the 2.5 version of Merriam-Webster compared to the 3.0 version... The new version of Longman has quite obvious improvements, but they are not very useful to me, because most of these practical features are already almost entirely in Word.

![](images/figure38.png)

The way Collins defines words is most suitable for English learners. For example, the sixth definition of the word "plug" is as follows:

> **6 plug plugs plugging plugged**

> *If someone plugs a commercial product, especially a book or a film, they praise it in order to encourage people to buy it or see it because they have an interest in it doing well.* <br />

> We did not want people on the show who are purely interested in **plugging** a book or film.

> **VB**<br />
*= promote*

By the way, if you want to know whether a dictionary's definitions are comprehensive, you can usually flip through the definitions of the word "plug". If you find this definition "v. insert an advertisement; n. small advertisement", it indicates that the dictionary's definitions are quite complete.

![](images/figure39.png)

Longman once became the leader of the "Learner’s Dictionary" because it designed a "Defining Vocabulary" containing 2200 words. Oxford followed suit and eventually had its own "Oxford 3000". Collins, in essence, went a step further. This "if ..., ..." simple sentence pattern is actually the most appropriate design and the most suitable explanation method for second language learners. Of course, Collins also has its own "basic definition vocabulary set", but it is named "Most Frequently Used Vocabulary", divided into 1~5 levels.

The Collins Dictionary is the only one on the market that comes with a searchable corpus. When looking up each word, in addition to the corresponding example sentences in the definitions, there is an "Examples" section under the "Full text" tab, which usually contains dozens or even hundreds of example sentences. The example words are highlighted in red, and it is indicated before the example sentences whether they are UK written, UK spoken, US written, or US spoken. Below "Example" there are several icons:

* The "D" icon stands for "Dictionary definition"
* The "T" icon stands for "Thesaurus entry"
* The "U" icon stands for "Usage notes"
* The "G" icon stands for "Grammar explanation" (this is a "secret feature" of the Collins Dictionary, which will be explained in detail later)
* The "W" icon stands for "WordBank example sentences"

![](images/figure40.png)

![](images/figure41.png)

![](images/figure42.png)

![](images/figure43.png)

The so-called "WordBank" is the example sentence corpus of the Collins Dictionary, which includes the effective part of this corpus containing 5 billion words. On the Collins website, there is also an [online search tool](http://www.collins.co.uk/Corpus/CorpusSearch.aspx) for this corpus - although for most non-professionals, this tool is not of much use.

The most intriguing part is the hidden content in the third edition of Collins Dictionary, the full electronic version of Collins Cobuild English Grammar. The Chinese version of this book is published by The Commercial Press; it's also one of the grammar books I highly recommend. (The discovery of this feature was purely accidental, a result of a keystroke error that led to a treasure.)

![](images/figure44.png)

By entering "1.1" in the input box of the Collins Dictionary and pressing enter, you can see the first section of the first chapter of the dictionary. You can then "flip" forward and backward using the "A←" and "→Z" icons on the toolbar. If you have a printed version and want to view the electronic version, you just need to enter the corresponding chapter number and press enter. (This excellent feature was removed in the fifth edition of Collins...)

## 8. Oxford Collocation Dictionary

The Oxford Collocation Dictionary for Students of English is a dictionary of epoch-making significance. The Oxford Phrasebuilder Genie software includes two important dictionaries, one is the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, and the other is the Oxford Collocation Dictionary for Students of English, for which there is almost no alternative currently available. In domestic bookstores, I have only seen the original version of this dictionary for sale on the fourth floor of the Wangfujing Foreign Language Bookstore in Beijing (about 380 RMB, including the printed version and CDROM; in addition, there is a "photocopied version" for sale on the first floor, which is very cheap, only a few tens of yuan). In 2009, this great dictionary finally released its second edition:

The Oxford Collocation Dictionary contains 15,000 collocation entries. For instance, if you search for "house," you can see that as a noun, "house" often serves as the object of verbs such as "live in," "occupy," "share," "buy," "rent," "sell," and so on (VERB+HOUSE).

![](images/figure47.png)

The advantage of having this dictionary is that we no longer have to rely on foreign teachers (in fact, we never could rely on them) to learn English. If you want to express something, just look it up. The so-called "authentic" use of language is more crucial in collocation — pronunciation, grammar, etc., are important, but not as important as collocation. Consider this:

> I hate purple passages with no essential content. (I detest texts that are all style and no substance.) (The term "passage" is modified by "purple," forming a phrase, "florid text or paragraph")

In this sentence, there are some grammatical errors; "purple passage" should be "purple passages" [plural], and "content" should also be "contents" [plural]. However, even if there are some grammatical errors, if a foreigner reads this slightly grammatically incorrect sentence with a not-so-standard pronunciation, a native English speaker can still understand it completely, and communication can be smoothly completed. This is the power of collocation.

The interface of the second edition is more user-friendly, making it relatively easier to use. When browsing, you can double-click any word with the left mouse button at any time. A small dialog box will pop up, containing the definition of the word and accompanied by a human voice pronunciation. This is the only dictionary that I personally think is worth flipping through the printed version when you have nothing to do - of course, the electronic version is the same.

## 9. WordNet and WordWeb

[WordNet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNet) is an English lexical database developed and maintained by George A. Miller, a psychology professor at Princeton University, starting in 1985. As of 2006, the WordNet database has exceeded 12M in size, including 150,000 words, a total of 115,000 sets of synonyms, and contains 207,000 word meaning entries. The words in this database are mainly divided into four types: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. The main structure of the database is a relational database based on word meanings (rather than vocabulary itself).

When this project just started in 1985, it received a grant of 3 million US dollars. Professor Miller's later career was mostly related to WordNet. Around 1998, a group of professors and students from Brown University used WordNet to create a "disambiguator" (used to eliminate the ambiguity encountered in semantic analysis). This group of people led by Jeff Stibel hired Professor Miller as a board advisor and created the Simpli search engine. In 2000, Simpli was acquired by NetZero for $23.5 million. In 2003, another company based on WordNet technology, Applied Semantics (the company was called "Oingo" in 1998), was acquired by Google for $102 million. Since then, Google has owned its life-sustaining AdSence advertising business...

Here is the translated content:

The following is a brief description of the database structure on Wikipedia:

* Nouns
  * Hypernyms: Y is a hypernym of X if every X is a (kind of) Y (canine is a hypernym of dog) (This is equivalent to what is called a "superordinate" in Chinese)
  * Hyponyms: Y is a hyponym of X if every Y is a (kind of) X (dog is a hyponym of canine) (This is equivalent to what is called a "subordinate" in Chinese)
  * Coordinate terms: Y is a coordinate term of X if X and Y share a hypernym (wolf is a coordinate term of dog, and dog is a coordinate term of wolf)
  * Holonyms: Y is a holonym of X if X is a part of Y (building is a holonym of window)
  * Meronym: Y is a meronym of X if Y is a part of X (a window is a meronym of a building)
* Verbs
  * Hypernym: The verb Y is a hypernym of the verb X if the activity X is a (kind of) Y (to perceive is a hypernym of to listen)
  * Troponym: The verb Y is a troponym of the verb X if the activity Y is doing X in some manner (to lisp is a troponym of to talk)
  * Entailment: The verb Y is entailed by X if by doing X you must be doing Y (to sleep is entailed by to snore)
  * Coordinate Terms: Those verbs sharing a common hypernym (to lisp and to yell)
* Adjectives
  * related nouns
  * similar to
  * participle of verb
* Adverbs
  * root adjectives

For English learners, this database is not very intuitive to understand. Because it is not a "dictionary" in the traditional sense, nor is it a "Thesaurus" in the traditional sense. To be precise, it was originally a giant word meaning association database built for automatic English semantic recognition.

You can also find a very cool and dazzling operation interface "[Thinkmap® Visual Thesaurus](http://www.visualthesaurus.com/)" on the Internet, which is also based on the WordNet database.

![](images/figure48.png)

However, apart from being cool and dazzling, I personally think that this TVT is not practical, inconvenient, and inefficient for most English learners.

## 10. Vocabulary is not a problem, the amount of concepts is the bottleneck

One day, students will find that "vocabulary" is really the most basic thing. When you can't understand the article, the bigger obstacle is actually the "amount of concepts". People who don't know what a "double blind test" is, it's not because they don't recognize the three words double, blind, and test, but because they don't understand what this concept is all about - of course, the chapter introducing this concept in a book may exceed a few thousand words, that is, you need to understand those thousands of words before you can fully understand what a "double blind test" is, why it depends on it, and what limitations it has when it depends on it, etc. For example, when a reader reads "[unintended consequences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequence)" during the reading process, if he does not know the origin of this concept, its meaning, and the examples often mentioned in real life and academia because of it, then this reader may not necessarily understand the meaning of the text just because he recognizes "unintended" and also recognizes "consequences".

Advanced cognitive activities depend on the understanding, organization, expansion, application, re-understanding, reorganization, further expansion, and further application of concepts (rather than vocabulary itself). There may be a huge difference in the amount of concepts between people with the same vocabulary. Not only is there a difference in the amount of concepts, but there is also a variety of differences in each person's understanding of each concept. When the difference in the amount of concepts between people reaches a certain level, they cannot communicate at all even when using the same language - this may be the case between parents and children, teachers and students, authors and readers, leaders and subordinates, southerners and northerners, scholars and the public.

People who don't know the concept of "double blind test" may be misdiagnosed by quacks without knowing it, and people who don't know "unintended consequences" find it difficult to get rid of the habit of self-righteousness, always doing bad things with good intentions...

* If you encounter someone of the opposite sex who doesn't understand that "love" and "marriage" are not the same thing, it's best to keep your distance, otherwise a painful life "is waiting for you not far away"...
* If you encounter someone who doesn't understand the difference between "government" and "state", don't communicate with them easily, otherwise you may find that troubles are endless and disasters are endless...
* People who don't know that "goals" and "plans" are not the same thing don't know that they may "stick to the plan" and ultimately fail to achieve their goals...
* Those who fail to distinguish between "science", "popular science", and "popular science authors" end up hurling insults at each other — their methods are less scientific than a fishwife's rant...
* People who don't understand that "going to school" and "learning" are not the same thing, some of them might look down on vocational school graduates because they have a doctoral degree; conversely, others might hate those with doctoral degrees because they only have a vocational diploma...
* People who don't understand the difference between "a person" and "a person's opinion", either might blindly follow authority, or consider themselves as the absolute authority...
* Those who don't understand the difference between "Action" and "Reaction", might just be slaves to their surroundings for their entire life, completely unconscious of their state...
* Many students hate history class, but it's just because they haven't understood the important difference between "history" and "history books"...

That's why we often hear people describe those who are ignorant in this way — "Ah! This person has no concept at all!" This phrase can also describe those with confused logic. In the end, it's always those who can clearly distinguish and define concepts who can think clearly, and then change the world:

* Galileo understood that "motion" and "medium of motion" are two concepts that should be handled separately, this alone is a huge contribution to modern science;
* Washington and his colleagues understood that the "three powers" could be separated, thus creating the America we know today.
* Deng Xiaoping clarified that "politics" and "economy" can be separated, which led to the creation of today's China;
* Some programmers realized that "content" and "presentation" can be separated. As a result, "css" was separated from "html" —— and the internet was transformed...

It seems like a digression, but it's not. This is not an intentional sensationalism, but a clear fact. Understanding each concept encountered (whether in Chinese or English) is the most time-saving and efficient way of life. Note that this habit not only affects learning, but in fact, it will influence a person's entire life process. After all, humans are animals that must rely on thinking to make decisions. And every decision, every judgment, depends on the effective handling of various complex concepts stored in one's brain.

Therefore, I often advise students to frequently consult encyclopedias, as it is the most basic tool for ordinary people to build a conceptual system. Whenever you encounter a concept that you don't understand very well, look it up in the encyclopedia, and then make some notes. It's a good habit for life. The only one I recommend to students is [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org).

People often have doubts about the authority of Wikipedia; in fact, in 2005, the world's most authoritative scientific journal, Nature, meticulously tested and compared the content of Wikipedia and the Encyclopedia Britannica, examined hundreds of indicators, and ultimately concluded that the accuracy of the content of both was comparable; in some aspects, Wikipedia even had the upper hand.

## 11. Is it necessary to use an "English-English dictionary"?

Many teachers emphasize to their students, "In order to learn English well, you must use an English-English dictionary." Personally, I don't agree with this advice. In fact, many students, after hearing this advice, just do as they are told, and in the end, they "die before they succeed" - because there are more unfamiliar words in the definitions they look up, and they give up not long after they "decide to start anew."

For a second language learner, it's very likely that they will never need to abandon the English-Chinese dictionary in their lifetime. This is because a considerable number of concepts exist correspondingly in any language. For example, apple, cockroach, fool, rock, ticket, etc. The definitions of these words in Merriam-Webster are as follows:

* **apple**: the fleshy usually rounded and red, yellow, or green edible pome fruit of a tree
* **cockroach**: any of an order or suborder (Blattodea syn. Blattaria) of chiefly nocturnal insects including some that are domestic pests
* **fool**: a person lacking in judgment or prudence
* **rock**: a concreted mass of stony material; also: broken pieces of such masses
* **ticket**: a document that serves as a certificate, license, or permit

Is it faster to understand the above definitions? Or are the following definitions faster to understand?

* apple: apple
* cockroach: cockroach
* fool: fool
* rock: rock
* ticket: ticket

Not only is the latter faster to understand, but the memory will also be faster. In short, this method is more efficient, so why give up a more efficient way?

Indeed, there are some words that exist in one language but do not exist in another. For example, the word "hooligan". At this time, the solution is not just to look at the English-English dictionary. The explanation in Merriam-Webster is:

> **hooligan**: RUFFIAN, HOODLUM

And many students may not know these two words, so they have to look up these two words separately (double-clicking with the left mouse button is not troublesome)

> **RUFFIAN**: a brutal person : BULLY
> **HOODLUM**: THUG; especially: one who commits acts of violence

And here's another word we don't recognize,

> **THUG**: a brutal ruffian or assassin : GANGSTER, KILLER

Now we basically know them all, but what does this word really mean, who can figure it out?

It's better to just use Kingsoft PowerWord and point the mouse:

> **hooligan**: [slang] Ah Fei, rogue, little hooligan

If you're not satisfied and want to know what hooligan really means, [why not just wikipedia it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooliganism):
> *Etymology*

> There are several theories about the origin of the word hooliganism. The Compact Oxford English Dictionary states that word may originate from the surname of a fictional rowdy Irish family in a music hall song of the 1890s. Clarence Rooks, in his 1899 book, Hooligan Nights, claimed that the word came from Patrick Hoolihan (or Hooligan), an Irish bouncer and thief who lived in the London borough of Southwark. Another writer, Earnest Weekley, wrote in his 1912 book Romance of Words, “The original hooligans were a spirited Irish family of that name whose proceedings enlivened the drab monotony of life in Southwark about fourteen years ago”. There have also been references made to a 19th century rural Irish family with the surname Houlihan who were known for their wild lifestyle. Another theory is that the term came from a street gang in Islington named Hooley. Yet another theory is that the term is based on an Irish word, houlie, which means a wild, spirited party.

——Oh, it turns out that they also can't figure it out. In this case, what needs to be checked is the etymology, or simply look it up in an encyclopedia, many times it's no longer a matter of the dictionary.

There's also a classic example, which is the French term déjà vu; this meaning does not exist in English, so it had to be borrowed directly; and in Chinese, I still can't find an exact complete corresponding term.

People often say that you must use an English-English dictionary to accurately understand the meaning of a word. In fact, the root of this statement is nothing more than seeing the problem correctly but getting the solution wrong, just as absurd as diagnosing a patient with a cerebral thrombosis and then performing an amputation on them.

Indeed, sometimes we can't determine the exact meaning of a word just by looking at the Chinese explanation, for example, "different", "diverse", "divergent", "distinct", "various" all mean "different", but when should each be used, what exactly is the difference, and how should they be used? But the solution to the problem is not to look up the "English-English dictionary", but to look up the "usage dictionary", "synonym dictionary" and "collocation dictionary" —— and these dictionaries usually have English-Chinese versions or English-Chinese bilingual versions.

For example, in Kingsoft PowerWord, there is the "New Oxford English-Chinese Bilingual Dictionary", using it to look up the word "different" gives the following result:

![](images/figure49.png)

And in the "Modern English-Chinese Comprehensive Dictionary", there is something called "reference vocabulary" (which is actually equivalent to a synonym dictionary), as shown in the following figure:

The results from the Oxford Collocation Dictionary (a collocation dictionary) are shown in the image below:

![](images/figure51.png)

Personally, I believe that the collocation dictionary is the most important among these, as the key differences between words are often reflected in their different collocations (recall how the differences between the Chinese characters "编" and "织" are reflected in their collocations).

Furthermore, I would like to remind students not to overly rely on dictionaries. The compilation of any language's dictionary is, in a sense, a last resort - because many words simply cannot be clearly explained using other words. Here's an example to prove this point in reverse. The definition of the word "清秀" in the "Modern Chinese Dictionary" is "beautiful and not vulgar". As a native speaker, do you think this explanation would help an American learning Chinese (who has followed his Chinese teacher's advice, saying "To learn Chinese well, you must use a Chinese-Chinese dictionary, not a Chinese-English dictionary...") understand? When we encounter a foreigner who doesn't understand what "清秀" means, we often don't tell them to look it up in a dictionary, but use the "example method" to explain: "Oh, so-and-so is quite '清秀'..."

As our reading breadth and depth increase, we will inevitably encounter authors who not only use precise words but also strive for innovative usage. Reading their texts, relying solely on a dictionary is definitely not enough.

So, the idea of improving one's skills solely by using an "English-English dictionary" is quite naive. Often, using an English-Chinese version, or an English-Chinese bilingual version, is the truly efficient method. In fact, whether it's an English-English dictionary, an English-Chinese dictionary, or an English-Chinese bilingual dictionary, the key is to look up words. Regardless of which one you use, if you look up words, you will gain something. If you cross-reference different dictionaries, you will gain unexpected insights, and if you look up words and record them diligently, you will gain lifelong benefits. However, if you don't look up words, it's useless. The main reason why most people have a low level of proficiency is not because they use poor tools, but because they don't know how to use tools, or even simply own tools but never use them.
