# Chapter 6: Grammar

## 1. Only the Uncultured Despise Grammar

Only the uncultured despise grammar — this statement might seem a bit harsh, but it's merely the truth. Often, people advocate for the idea that "one can get by without learning grammar" for various reasons, and they often gain popularity for this. However, this is nothing more than fools deceiving the gullible, essentially a group of uncultured people indulging in collective delusion. Going to the market to buy groceries, indeed, does not require an understanding of grammar, because all that's spoken are short sentences, fragmented sentences:

> A: How much per pound?<br />
> B: Two dollars and twenty cents.<br />
> A: Expensive.<br />
> B: Not expensive! I'll give you a discount if you buy more...<br />
> A: Okay, give me two pounds.<br />
> B: Two pounds and three ounces, okay?<br />
> A: Okay.<br />
> B: I'll round down the change, that'll be five dollars...<br />
> A: Hmm, thank you.<br />
> B: Alright!<br />

But isn't our purpose of learning language and text not merely to speak in such situations? Slightly more complex thoughts face certain difficulties in expression — if even grammar is not up to par, how can one express clearly? And when those with thoughts use language to express their ideas, if the reader's grammar is not up to par, misunderstandings are inevitable.

The Commercial Press is a rather good publishing house, yet it often causes distress. For instance, in Milton Friedman's "The Curse of Money: Fragments of Monetary History," there is a translated sentence like this:

> Money is not to be joked about, so it should be entrusted to the central bank.

People familiar with Friedman's views would be startled, "Ah? When did the old man change his mind?!"

But the original text is like this (this is Friedman quoting Georges Clemenceau):

> Money is much too serious a matter to be left to the central bankers.

Just because there was an extra "much" in front of the "too...to" structure, the translator got it wrong due to poor grammar foundation. In fact, the translator translated a whole book (for translation, one must "study" - more careful than "intensive reading", "extensive reading", "skimming"), but didn't understand the content of the book at all. So, they didn't see the contradiction between this sentence and the content of the whole book... Isn't this a lack of culture?

Originally, there should be a division of labor in this world. It is said that the great division of labor has brought about unprecedented productivity improvement. If those who have a talent for learning foreign languages can learn foreign languages well and specialize in translation, then some other people who do not have a talent for learning foreign languages but have other talents can do what they are good at - then everyone can use money to carry out exchange activities, and the social benefits will greatly increase. Unfortunately, unfortunately. Many times, even if we don't have talent, we have to grit our teeth and learn foreign languages well, otherwise it's too much of a loss.

If one has the opportunity to interact with people from various cultures, they would realize that, in fact, people from any culture on Earth are the same - most people dislike or even hate learning grammar. Many years ago, the British spent a lot of time and effort in their language classes teaching students the so-called "Parsing" method of grammar analysis. However, it has now been abandoned due to the so-called "modern education reform" (which is just another "overdoing" change like any other reform in this field):

> **Parsing**: The lost art of identifying all the components of a text, and once one of the fundamental exercises that tested and informed pupils in English. To parse a phrase such as 'man bites dog' involves noting that the singular noun 'man' is the subject of the sentence, the verb 'bites' is the third person singular of the present tense of the verb to bite, and the singular noun 'dog' is the object of the sentence.

> – Dictionary of Modern English Grammar, by Ned Halley, Wordsworth, 2005

Is this basic language training as useless as those "radical reformers" think, to the point where it must be abandoned? Not at all. In fact, these so-called reformers, despite their foolishness, are "successful" in the course of history because they "surprisingly" defeated reason with unreasonableness. It's not surprising at all, fools can always "successfully" ruin the world, such examples are everywhere, because fools are the easiest to find (many) companions, and therefore are most likely to become the majority in voting activities... The sentence pattern they most often hang on their lips is: "......otherwise why would everyone......?" —— Although sentences using this sentence pattern sometimes do make sense.

## 2. Learn Grammar No Matter What

[Winston Churchill](http://www.winstonchurchill.org/), the British Prime Minister who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953, once described how important this language training was to him as a child:

> By being so long in the lowest form I gained an immense advantage over the cleverer boys. They all went on to learn Latin and Greek and splendid things like that. But I was taught English. We were considered such dunces that we could learn only English. Mr. Somervell — a most delightful man, to whom my debt is great — was charged with the duty of teaching the stupidest boys the most disregarded thing–namely, to write mere English. He knew how to do it. He taught it as no one else has ever taught it. Not only did we learn English parsing thoroughly, but we also practised continually English analysis. Mr. Somervell had a system of his own. He took a fairly long sentence and broke it up into its components by means of black, red, blue, and green inks. Subject, verb, object: Relative Clauses, Conditional Clauses, Conjunctive and Disjunctive Clauses! Each had its colour and its bracket. It was a kind of drill. We did it almost daily. As I remained in the Third Form three times as long as anyone else, I had three times as much of it. I learned it thoroughly. Thus I got into my bones the essential structure of the ordinary British sentence — which is a noble thing. And when in after years my schoolfellows who had won prizes and distinction for writing such beautiful Latin poetry and pithy Greek epigrams had to come down again to common English, to earn their living or make their way, I did not feel myself at any disadvantage. Naturally I am biased in favor of boys learning English. I would make them all learn English: and then I would let the clever ones learn Latin as an honour, and Greek as a treat. But the only thing I would whip them for is not knowing English, I would whip them hard for that.

> – My Early Life: A Roving Commission, Thornton Butterworth [UK] and Charles Scribner’s Sons [US], 1930)

American President Abraham Lincoln also placed great importance on grammar. Lincoln had only a few years of schooling, yet he firmly believed that God had given him a mission to accomplish. (There are always some people in the crowd — by no means the majority — who have this peculiar intuition, regardless of whether they have religious beliefs or not. For example, Chinese writer Wang Shuo once wrote: "I know I have a history, and this feeling is particularly strong when I walk among the masses..." I guess this is not Wang Shuo being pretentious, he is just one of many who have this peculiar intuition.)

In order to become an influential public figure, Lincoln often had to walk a long distance to attend William Mentor Graham's speech training. However, Lincoln's progress was slow and his performance was not up to par. Fortunately, Lincoln was insightful and realized the importance of grammar:

> "Spoke to me one day and said: 'I had a notion of studying grammar', recalled Graham. "There was none in the village and I said to him: 'I know of a grammar at one Vance’s (a man named John Vance), about six miles. Got up and went on foot to Vance’s and got the book. He soon came back and told me he had it. He then turned his immediate and almost undivided attention to English grammar. The book was Kirkham’s Grammar, an old (1826) volume."

Lincoln also discovered a close connection between many people's confused thinking and poor grammar:

> Monday, [April] 24th

> Last Saturday, we had General Rosecrans before our committee, and his account of the campaign in Western Virginia makes McClellan look worse than ever. Last Friday, I went with the Indianans to call on President Johnson. Governor Morton overstepped the bounds of propriety by reading a carefully prepared essay on the subject of reconstruction. Johnson embarked on the same topic, indulging in bad grammar, poor pronunciation, and much incoherent thought. Like many others, I was mortified.

But why does something so important attract the disdain and even hatred of most people? Perhaps it's because the benefits of learning grammar are not immediately apparent. People generally dislike things that are indirect. The root cause lies in the inherent shortsightedness of humans. This is not shameful, as it is determined by our genes:

> The evolutionary costs and benefits of innovations work much like the economics of pharmaceutical research. The Pfizer Corporation spent over $100 million and many years developing the drug Viagra before the drug made a single cent of profit. The costs were incurred early on, and the benefits only came later. Drug companies can cope with this delayed gratification, and have the foresight to undertake the research that leads to such profitable innovations. But evolution lacks foresight. It doesn't have the long-term vision of drug company management. A species can't raise venture capital to pay its bills while its research team tries to turn an innovative idea into a market-dominating biological product. Each species has to stay biologically profitable every generation, or else it goes extinct.

> – The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature, by Geoffrey Miller, ANCHOR BOOKS 2000

Because shortsightedness is actually human nature, we are always involuntarily influenced by it. People learn to ride bicycles faster than they learn grammar, not only because grammar is more complex, but also perhaps because you can quickly learn to ride a bicycle and then immediately experience various conveniences; while learning grammar is not only monotonous and time-consuming, but the most deadly thing is always feeling "I don’t know what it’s for?" This question is the fundamental reason why many people give up learning —— I have a detailed discussion in "Making Time a Friend".

Churchill, not only has a solid foundation in grammar, it is said that his vocabulary is the largest among modern people. It is said that the vocabulary he has used (including manuscripts and speeches) totals more than 60,000, while most ordinary people can use about 20,000 in written language at most, and only about 5,000 in spoken language. But Churchill is not perfect:

> If one were looking for an iconic image of the Second World War that summed up Allied pluck and derring-do it would have to be that of Winston Churchill with index and middle finger raised in a defiant “V” for “Victory” sign. Revered for his strength of character and his willful defiance of Nazi Germany when Britain stood alone against the Third Reich, Winston Churchill is cherished throughout the world as one of the war’s most heroic figures. His legacy during one of the darkest eras in human history paints a portrait of the man as a wonderful, larger-than-life personality—a characterization that overshadows his faults and shortcomings in those crucial years. But those faults and shortcomings had a devastating legacy of their own. Winston Churchill: The Flawed Genius of World War II examines the decisions and policies Churchill made in the vital months between June 1940 and December 1941 that prolonged the war, allowed for millions of casualties, and left half of Europe behind the Iron Curtain. In 1941 Britain was waging a successful campaign against Italy in North Africa. General O’Connor could in fact have beaten them altogether and thereby prevented Rommel and his army from even landing. However, Churchill made the fatal decision to switch key British and Commonwealth divisions from North Africa to Greece in order to defend that country from German invasion, a heroic but guaranteed-to-fail gesture, and fail it did. When the United States entered the war, George Marshall’s victory plan was to launch an invasion of the Continent—what would become operation Overlord—early in 1943 and force a direct engagement of the enemy. But Churchill’s decision to remove troops to Greece stalled Britain’s victory in North Africa and enabled Rommel and his crack Afrika Korps to gain a foothold. Now Churchill urged Roosevelt to help beleaguered British troops in the African desert and that meant diverting troops from Marshall’s victory plan. It made landing in northwestern Europe entirely impossible, and D-day, the main objective of attacking Germany directly, through France, was postponed until June 1944. As a result, by the time the Allies landed in Normandy, Soviet troops were further west than they would have been in 1943. In that crucial year, millions of civilians—Jewish, Russian, Polish, and German—died who might have lived. By the war’s end Stalin had already eclipsed half of Europe. Had D-day been earlier the Iron Curtain may have fallen with very different and diminished borders and millions of Central Europeans could have lived in freedom from 1945-1989. While Churchill’s was only one player in the drama that allowed this calamity to happen, Christopher Catherwood contends that it certainly tarnished the legacy of his “finest hour.”

Another individual who was equally outstanding in delivering captivating speeches and influencing the masses was a man often referred to as a demon, Hitler. However, Hitler's grasp of grammar was as poor as it could get:

> In August 1908, Hitler wrote a letter to Gustl that clearly demonstrates his mediocre success in mastering the most basic usages of German spelling and grammar, let alone any coherent subject matter. The handwriting is childish, two words are scratched out and rewritten, other words are misspelled, punctuation is haphazard, and the style is rambling and disconnected. German spelling does not present the same kind of difficulty to the young student that English does. There are no vestigial spellings like though, touch, read, colonel, psalm, and such in German, which is spelled with dependable regularity. For young Hitler, however, the German language was filled with booby traps. The spelling in his letter is often erratic: dann becomes dan, sofort becomes soffort, Katarrh is spelled chartar, dies is spelled with two s’s, and so on. His use of capitals in this correspondence is also unpredictable.* Punctuation is omitted. In the August letter, as in others, he never used a question mark. He asks “Who really published the newspaper I sent you last time” without a question mark. In the sentence “Have you read the last decisions of the municipal council in connection with the new Teater,” Theater is spelled without the h, which is part of the German as well as the English word, and again the sentence ends without a question mark. So does the following sentence: “Do you know any details.” The pronoun sie, meaning either “they” or “she,” is not capitalized in German usage, although Sie, the formal pronoun meaning “you,” is. Hitler, however, capitalizes sie for “they” and for “she,” just as he haphazardly capitalizes other pronouns that should be lowercased. Words are hopelessly run together—in one case seven of them—to make one long misspelled and incoherent formulation.

Just as some people are tone-deaf and sing off-key, I suppose there must be similar obstacles for some people when it comes to grammar? Just as a tone-deaf person can never produce heavenly music no matter how hard they try, we cannot forbid them from singing karaoke. Similarly, what if some people study grammar diligently but can never quite master it? So what? We shouldn't mock them for this, nor do we have any right to forbid them from speaking or writing. In a sense, using words is much like singing karaoke. Sometimes, the key is not how well you speak or write, but how much passion you put into it.

## 3. The Illusion that Hinders Grammar Learning - "I didn't learn Chinese grammar, but I can still use Chinese well, right?"

Refusing to learn is equivalent to refusing to evolve. To use an inappropriate analogy, those who refuse to learn are like monkeys who are content to remain as they are and do not wish to evolve into humans. However, many people refuse to evolve often because they believe they have perfectly reasonable reasons. For example, many people refuse to learn English grammar and often use this seemingly irrefutable reason:

> Look, I've never learned Chinese grammar, but I can still use Chinese well! So, grammar is useless, learning it is simply a waste of time!

Is this really the case?

In fact, there are even more exaggerated examples they haven't thought of: even illiterate people (who of course have not learned grammar) hardly make grammatical errors when using their mother tongue. However, this does not prove that grammar is useless. Even illiterate people live in a mother tongue environment where everyone around them is speaking correct sentences. The most basic method of language learning is imitation. You say something, and I follow along, and it's bound to be correct - in fact, almost 99.9% of what we say is repeating sentences we've heard or seen before. Therefore, even illiterates can't possibly make grammatical errors in every sentence. However, it is also obvious that illiterates usually express simple thoughts, using simple vocabulary and sentence structures, which also reduces the possibility of them making mistakes from another perspective.

Incidentally, this is precisely why I vehemently discourage students from rushing to so-called "English corners" to "learn English." In these English corners, what most people speak is not genuinely correct English, but more likely "original English." On the one hand, people around them are uttering incorrect sentences, and on the other hand, they adamantly refuse to learn grammar. If this isn't courting death, what is? Some people seek defeat in solitude, but in English corners, it's collective suicide — and they all think they're having a party...

Many people believe that they can "use their mother tongue proficiently without having studied grammar," primarily because they unconsciously overestimate themselves.

> People are particularly prone to overestimating themselves, with the vast majority of adults being overly confident in their mother tongue proficiency. They think their mother tongue level is high, but they forget another fact: their mother tongue level is likely only at a level that is just passable for native speakers. However, most adults, after graduating from school (according to our education system curriculum, it's more likely after high school), are no longer forced to take various language exams, no longer have the opportunity to feel inferior due to poor exam results, and naturally think their language level is "quite high" — "better than middle school students, right?" They think this way, but in reality, it's not necessarily true. How many undergraduates (even including a considerable portion of graduate students and PhDs) enter society and can't write a decent rental contract, or can't fully understand the employment agreement they signed. Many people often misinterpret others' speeches or articles, not out of malice, but simply because their text comprehension level is so poor that they often "can't hear" or "can't see" some important content. Imagine, the vast majority of people (this ratio will definitely exceed 99%) no matter how carefully they write a manuscript, no matter how many times they revise it themselves, the possibility of it being "not needing a single word changed" before formal publication is almost zero — there are more likely some unintentional typos, hidden or obvious grammatical errors, presumptuous expressions, etc., which often require another person to scrutinize repeatedly. Many people neglect the cultivation of their mother tongue, like ostriches burying their heads when facing danger, they dive headfirst into English learning, which is not necessarily intentional, the deeper reason is likely just a misestimation of their mother tongue level.

Most people's native language grammar is actually not up to par, but because they have graduated from school, they therefore believe they have "passed." One of the important reasons why the education system is doomed to fail is that every subject has to artificially set a standard of 100 points and then set a passing line of 60 points, completely disregarding how absurd that standard is in reality. Does a student who scores 100 points in math really master 100% of math knowledge? Does a student who scores 60 points in English really master 60% of all English knowledge? For the majority of people who can only score eighty or ninety points in a full score of 100 points in a Chinese test, do they really "automatically qualify" once they graduate?

On the other hand, while they overestimate themselves, they also lower the standard. They inadvertently reduce "proficient use of the mother tongue" to the level of "being able to use the mother tongue proficiently for daily communication" - the fluency and proficiency in the vegetable market and the fluency and proficiency in formal occasions are not the same thing at all. Once they want to write articles for others to read, or speak in public for many people to listen to, most people will instantly realize how bad their grammar is, and then quickly give up, and then start to resist speaking and writing articles. Surveys show that in any culture, the first thing people fear most is death, followed closely by public speaking. However, being able to realize that their grammar is poor is still sober. The vast majority of people attribute their poor performance to reasons such as poor psychological quality, poor performance, and insufficient preparation, which sound relatively "grandiose", and avoid the fact that they completely fail in two most important aspects: grammar and thinking ability. In order to express effectively, didn't Lincoln also honestly study grammar for several years before he confidently participated in the election?

Furthermore, many people's so-called "I've never studied grammar" is simply a complete illusion. How could it be possible that they haven't learned anything after attending so many language classes and taking so many language exams from childhood to adulthood? This doesn't even take into account the grammatical knowledge acquired subconsciously through various input methods, as well as the so-called "native language intuition" for correct grammar. If you say "I've never studied seriously," that's true. And precisely because of this, most people's language expression skills are not good (even failing). I have no intention of persuading everyone to study grammar seriously (whether it's Chinese or English), I just clarify the truth. After that, it's the reader's own choice. Do you think you are a person with knowledge and culture? Or a person who can survive a lifetime with only short sentences and broken sentences? Take what you need.

## 4. Understand the structure and query method of grammar books

There is a little bit of method to reading grammar books. Many people can't handle grammar simply because they are too anxious. They always want to flip through a grammar book all at once, but the result is not only that they fail to achieve their goal quickly, but they also stagnate forever. When you get a grammar book, you should first imagine it as a map. Have you ever seen someone who bought a map and then sat there and looked at every corner of the map and then directly memorized the map? Most people are not well-trained special forces, and there is no need to do so in a lifetime.

When you get a map, we already know the general idea: the map is north up, south down, west left, and east right, what kind of lines are highways, what kind of lines are subways, what kind of signs are bus stations... We have this common sense because we have seen some maps in the past. The same is true for grammar books. The structure of most grammar books is similar. They start with "articles", and then nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, etc., and the chapter about verbs almost occupies 2/3 of the grammar book (because there are many details such as tense, voice, mood, etc. to explain)...

Just as we would consult a map when we want to go somewhere, we should consult a grammar book when we want to understand a particular aspect of grammar. It's impossible to remember everything in a grammar book after reading it once, just as it's unlikely to remember an entire map after looking at it once. Most of the time, we become familiar with a grammar book by repeatedly consulting it, just as we become familiar with a map by repeatedly referring to it. There are always places on a map that we may never need to go to in our lifetime, and there are also grammar points that some people may never need to use in their lifetime. The most commonly used grammar knowledge should be memorized through repeated consultation and application, and for the rest, it's enough to be able to look it up in a grammar book when needed.

Of course, a grammar book is more complex than a typical map. In addition to the table of contents that tells us the basic structure of the book, there is also an important "index" at the end of the book. Through the index, we can find out where important keywords have appeared. When we encounter a sentence that we don't understand even though there are no new words, we might guess, "Which grammar point have I not understood that makes this sentence incomprehensible to me?" The first thing to do is to identify the "function words". Function words are those words that are specifically explained in the grammar book, such as "that", "and", "as", "of", etc.

A long time ago, I read a sentence, "Woman as she is, she’s very brave." It's a sentence composed entirely of basic vocabulary, and I was completely baffled. In this situation, I had no choice but to consult a grammar book. What should I look up? This sentence contains a function word "as". So, I took the "Longman English Grammar", turned to the index page (page 595), and saw the numerical notation after "as", which told me that the explanation of "as" had appeared in the following chapters:

> **as**: conjunction in clauses concession 1.50, manner 1.47.1 reason 1.48.1, time 1.45.1, as and because 1.48.2; not so much … as 5.13; with past progressive 9.20.2; preposition 8.4.4. the same as 6.30.4 as like, such as App 25.25

In fact, the answer is already emerging. If you look at section 1.50, you'll see that 'as' can be used to express concession in this type of sentence, and if you look at section 1.48.1, you'll see that this type of sentence can also express cause and effect logic.

Then, I casually picked up the "New English Reading Manual" and found this section in the table of contents: "The main uses and identification of 'As' (see grammar directory on page 15)... (33)". So, I started reading from page 33 of this book. I kept reading until page 38, where I found this:

> III. Concession adverbial clause conjunction 'as' Although, Despite, Regardless.
> 1. Busy as he is, he studies English very hard. Despite being busy, he still studies English diligently.
Here are the translations for the paragraphs in the second block:

> 3. Much as I would like to see you, I fear you may not have any spare time.
> 6. No matter how much he studies, he won't get good grades because his study method is unscientific.
> This type of concessive adverbial clause is characterized by the fact that the predicate, adverbial, or transitive verb in the clause is followed by other components, even though this is 'as'.
> It must be noted that this sentence pattern can occasionally be used to express a causal adverbial clause. It can only be judged based on the context. If there is a contrast in meaning between the main clause and the subordinate clause, the subordinate clause is a concessive adverbial clause; if there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the main clause and the subordinate clause, the subordinate clause is a causal adverbial clause. For example:
> 7.a Old as he is, he dares to brave the icy dangers of the North.
> 7.b Old as he is, he has to go to bed early.
Now I fully understand what "Woman as she is, she's very brave." really means. After a few more days, I came across this sentence: "Isolated as it is, the house is very quiet." —— There's no doubt left in my mind.

Looking up grammar books is this simple:

1. Identify function words,
2. Search the index,
3. Browse through the relevant content one by one to see if you can find a suitable answer.

If you can't find a satisfactory answer in one grammar book, then switch to another one, and you'll eventually find the answer. Sometimes, even if you've found the answer in one grammar book, you can still flip through another one, because doing so can always find some supplementary information.

## 5. Many Chinese students learn mathematical grammar instead of language grammar

Many people treat English in the same way they treat elementary mathematics, which is an overly simplistic view, or rather, an unrealistic idea and practice.

Elementary mathematics is actually not that interesting because it's too simple. Everything is definite, impeccable. Understand some "axioms" that don't need to be understood or debated, then deduce or simply memorize a bunch of "theorems" and "formulas", and then you can achieve "impeccable" proof, or "correct without error" results. English grammar (in fact, the grammar of all languages is like this) is very complex. There are few axioms and theorems in grammar, and more are "rules" with many exceptions. In this sense, learning grammar is obviously much harder than learning elementary mathematics, it's simply not on the same level.

When I was in high school, I was placed in what is known as the "science class" according to our country's custom. Just by intuition, I knew that the so-called superiority of most "science students" was nothing more than a self-righteous illusion. It wasn't until calculus and probability statistics that mathematics truly became fascinating. At this point, mathematics began to deal with complexity and uncertainty - the key essence of life lies in its complexity and uncertainty. However, those who were once "illusioned with superiority as science students" have long lost their "interest" in mathematics.

Whether it's mathematics or English (or any other language for that matter), they are each one of the many ways to describe this world. Elementary mathematics (such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, etc.) is only used to describe a part of this world, while language bears the task of "trying to describe the whole world", so it is obviously much more complex than elementary mathematics and cannot achieve "perfection" or "relative perfection".

To understand the essence of grammar. Essentially, grammar is not about "dictating how you should speak", but rather "systematically" explaining "why people generally speak this way". Therefore, grammar rules cannot be treated as mathematical formulas, and they do not guarantee that the sentences pieced together by them will definitely make sense and be correct. A sentence like "I saw blue and red snowflakes flying in the river." actually has no grammatical errors, but it is usually considered to be obviously absurd and meaningless.

The grammar of any natural language is always composed of many rules full of exceptions. This fact is one of the important reasons why many second language learners hate or dislike grammar. However, this hatred and disgust are actually manifestations of "simple-mindedness," "brutal thinking," and "naive childishness." Think about it, in the world we live in, "rules with exceptions" are everywhere, while the opposite "rules without any exceptions" are relatively few, even almost to the point of many existences in reality. Murder is definitely a crime, punishable by severe punishment, but if the murderer is a minor, the penalty is definitely different; consensual sex is innocent, but if one party is under 14 years old and the other party is over 18 years old, the situation is very different.

Don't be impatient with grammar rules. It is precisely this impatience that causes many people to lose one of the most important tools they could master, English. There are no shortcuts to learning English or simply using English, but there are definitely tricks. One of the important tricks is to be patient. This is too general. The important thing is, why be patient? Rely on understanding, thorough understanding. Just mentioned that the essence of grammar is just to explain "why people generally say this", so there is really no reason to "recite" grammar rules; what should be done is to try to "understand" grammar rules, understand, equivalent to remember. People who use the action of "understanding" are obviously more patient than those who use the action of "reciting". For example, understanding that grammar is nothing more than a "systematized collection of rules with exceptions as much as possible" makes it easier to be patient. No longer feel that those exceptions are hateful, just feel that those exceptions are naturally existing. No longer confused by the system of grammar books, but clearly know that it is not easy to do this "quite systematic".

## 6. You Should Own More Than One Grammar Book

### 6.1 "Longman English Grammar" and "Longman Advanced English Grammar Reference and Practice"

The author of "Longman English Grammar" is Louis Alexander, who also wrote "New Concept English," a book that has influenced several generations of Chinese people. The grammatical theoretical structure of this book is familiar to Chinese students. The index is very detailed, making it very convenient for lookups. It can be considered an essential reference for English learners, users, and teachers.

What many people don't know is that there is actually a companion workbook for this book, titled "Longman Advanced English Grammar Reference and Practice" by L.G. Alexander (Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press). Few people buy "Longman Advanced English Grammar Reference and Practice" at the same time as they purchase "Longman English Grammar" — but in reality, it's a must!

"Longman Advanced English Grammar Reference and Practice" contains a total of 60 units. Each unit is equipped with a reading article, followed by corresponding grammar exercises. After each answer, there is an index number like "5.32.1" — this tells you that the grammar knowledge involved in this question is discussed in section 5.32.1 of "Longman English Grammar." As for the page number of section 5.32.1, you can find it in the index of "Longman English Grammar."

### 6.2 "Cambridge Intermediate English Grammar"

If you want to master English grammar, relying on what is taught in school definitely won't work. Why not? I don't feel like explaining, but it just won't work, believe it or not. You can only rely on yourself. Rely on your reading ability, your ability to execute plans, and the patience that you can gradually cultivate.

The first book to introduce is "Cambridge Intermediate English Grammar," authored by Raymond Murphy and published by the Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press. The original title of this book is "English Grammar in Use." It's a mystery how the Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press translated "English in Use" (Practical English) into "English in Use." Many years ago, my father somehow found me a photocopied version of the first edition. Since then, I've bought many copies to give to people I know, and it's already the second edition. There are several versions available in bookstores now. Oxford recently published the third edition of this book. It's already available for download on verycd.com. The word "intermediate" in the Chinese translated title is probably because Raymond Murphy also wrote "Basic Grammar in Use"; and Oxford has also published another book in the series, "Advanced Grammar in Use" (authored by Martin Hewings).

In many grammar books before this, there are all sorts of sentences concocted out of thin air just to demonstrate grammar rules, like "Birds sing." This book is different. The advantage of this book is that all the example sentences inside are real, most commonly used, and carefully selected from everyday life. So, in fact, this book is not only a grammar workbook, readers can even use this book as a great spoken English textbook. Every sentence inside is worth memorizing.

Doing substitution exercises is the most effective way to master grammatical knowledge. For example, you might see a sentence in the book like this: "I've lost my key." You might find that if you were to express the same idea, you might say "I lost my key," or even, if your grammatical knowledge isn't solid, you might say "I lose my key." —— That is, this is a grammar point you need to learn. At this point, the Chinese phrase "present perfect tense" doesn't really mean anything to you. Even if you understand and remember this phrase, so what? When speaking English, you can't always be calculating in your head "Which tense should I use?" —— There are 16 tenses in total! So, doing substitution exercises repeatedly is effective: "I’ve lost my ________." Fill in the blank, for example: "job", "money", "house", "bike", "girlfriend"...... After replacing this sentence six or seven times in a row, "I’ve lost my" has become a whole string in your mind. In the future, when you want to express yourself, what you can say smoothly is, "I've lost my..." What you need to think about in your mind is what exactly is the thing you lost —— not which tense should I use?

This book introduces over 100 important grammar points, with odd-numbered pages introducing a section and even-numbered pages providing fill-in-the-blank exercises for the previous page. If you read 2-3 sections a day and complete the subsequent exercises, you can finish the book in a little over two months. The vast majority of people, even if they make up their minds, can't finish even once in their lifetime. Persisting for two months is not an easy task. In fact, doing it once is not enough. You have to force yourself to do it at least three times —— a total of about half a year. Trust me, half a year is not a long time. If you really do it more than three times, you will gain everything back. Trust me, the vast majority of people don't understand this point, so they keep going to training classes, spending who knows how much money, and in the end, they still have to solve the problems they didn't solve before —— it still takes half a year, and they still can't do it. Of course, the most common and saddest people I see are those who never believe that all their problems stem from their unwillingness to patiently understand and clarify the most basic things.

### 6.3 "Collins COBUILD Complete English Grammar"

Actually, the original English title of this book is quite simple, called "Collins COBUILD English Grammar" (Commercial Press). I don't know why the Commercial Press added an unnecessary word "Complete" when publishing this book - it's as helpless as a beauty accidentally getting cheap perfume on her body.

This English grammar book, introduced in 1999, is rarely used, but it is actually a milestone work. The earliest grammar books that domestic readers came into contact with were mostly from Zhang Daozhen and Xu Guozhang, which can be regarded as the first generation of grammar books. Later, Chinese people had the opportunity to buy the next generation of grammar books, such as the relatively classic "Longman English Grammar" - from the author of "New Concept English", Louis Alexander. By the time of Collins' "English Grammar", it can already be regarded as the third generation. The biggest feature of this grammar book is:

* All example sentences come entirely from a database built based on real-world corpora. It's no longer like previous grammar books, filled with sentences like "Birds sing." that were fabricated just to demonstrate grammar rules and actually don't exist in the real world.
* Pay more attention to "**pragmatics**". This grammar book is "function-oriented", not just the past "rule-oriented". It no longer defines the positive from the negative like past grammar books. Past grammar books always had to pay more attention to "you can't do this and that"; but in this grammar book, readers see more such suggestions - "If you want to ... then you can ...". That is, this grammar book defines the positive from the positive more - this is an important progress in the field of grammar (it requires a large corpus as the foundation to develop in this way).

It's worth mentioning that Chapter 9 (Text Composition) and Chapter 10 (Information Structure) in this grammar book are areas that have not been clearly covered in all other previous grammar books. Past grammar books started with parts of speech and abruptly ended at sentences, which greatly discounted the applicability of grammar books. Of course, there are also many seemingly trivial but actually very important contents in other chapters that have not been touched upon in other grammar books.

Another feature is the word lists that fill every page. The following is just one example:

> The following nouns are used to refer back to ideas, while also expressing an attitude towards these ideas:
> analysis, assessment, assumption, attitude, belief, conclusion, conjecture, concept, deduction, delusion, diagnosis, doctrine, doubt, estimate, evaluation, fear, finding, guess, hope, idea, illusion, inference, insight, interpretation, misinterpretation, notion, opinion, picture, plan, position, reasoning, supposition, theory, thinking, view, viewpoint, vision, wish
Students preparing for the GRE/GMAT/SAT essay can immediately see how important this organization method is for second language users. As for grammar books based on corpora, it seems that this is the only one available in China at present. There are many types of English dictionaries based on corpora, among which the most useful might be the "Oxford Collocation Dictionary for Students of English". Of course, there's also the "Collins COBUILD Dictionary on CD-ROM 2006" (now available in Lingoes version). In older versions of the Collins electronic dictionary, it contains the original English content of the "Collins COBUILD English Grammar".

The "Collins COBUILD English Grammar" introduced by the Commercial Press is actually not a bestseller - simply because most readers do not know the benefits of this grammar book (perhaps another reason is that this book "seems a bit expensive" - priced at 65 RMB). Almost at the same time, the Commercial Press also introduced a set of ten categorized grammar books, called the "COLLINS COBUILD English Grammar Series", which includes:

1. Prepositions
2. Word Formation
3. Articles
4. Confusable Words
5. Reported Speech
6. Homonyms
7. Metaphors
8. Spelling
9. Conjunctions
10. Determiners and Quantifiers

Each of these books is a must-have grammar book for English teachers (in my personal opinion), and if students really want to excel in English, it's absolutely worth spending more time on. In my own experience, "Metaphor" and "Conjunctions" had the biggest impact on me. Generally speaking, grammar books are used for reference, but these Collins books, I've basically flipped through several times. Unfortunately, this grammar series sold even worse (I heard that the Commercial Press lost money on this series), and it's hard to buy the whole set in bookstores (including online bookstores like Dangdang).

### 6.4 "New English Reading Manual"

The last grammar book I want to mention is Mr. Ye Yongchang's "New English Reading Manual". I learned about Ye Yongchang from my father's desk. For me, my father's bookshelf was a treasure trove; but there were a few books that were always on his desk, not on the bookshelf, and those on the desk were his treasures. One of them was the "Practical Science and Technology English Reading Manual". I later found out that this book had a cumulative circulation of 1.3 million copies - there should be very few scholarly works in China that could reach this number.

That "Practical Science and Technology English Reading Manual", my father actually had two copies - there was a clean one on the bookshelf; and the one on his desk had dense notes on almost every page, my father could write very small and neat characters with a ballpoint pen. Later when I went to university, my father said he would give me a few books; so he took the clean "Practical Science and Technology English Reading Manual" off the bookshelf; I said, "Dad, I want the one on your desk." Later, when I was a junior, losing this book in the library was one of the most regrettable things in my life; I never mentioned it to my father again.

Many years later, I saw Mr. Ye Yongchang's improved version of "New English Reading Manual" in a bookstore and bought it on the spot (I bought several more copies to give to a few friends). Over the years, this book has almost been worn out, but there are not so many notes - because my handwriting is too messy and I have been used to taking notes on the computer for many years. I often wonder, did the person who took that book from the library that year really understand the importance of those notes? If they did, there would be no regrets.

The "New English Reading Manual" was published by Shanghai Science and Technology Literature Publishing House in 2001, and the first edition was cautiously printed only 5000 copies. I often mention this book in class, but my students say "it can't be found anywhere". There was a time when you could see the introduction of this book on Dangdang.com, but it was always out of stock.

In the second half of 2008, I asked someone to contact Shanghai Science and Technology Literature Publishing House to inquire whether it was possible to request a reprint. After a long time, the publishing house finally replied, saying that it could only be printed if there were more than 2000 copies, and it needed to be purchased in full, with no possibility of return. So I ordered 2500 copies; and in 2009, I reprinted another 2500 copies - my students finally had the opportunity to use this grammar book.

On June 10, 2009, I finally had the opportunity to meet Mr. Ye Yongchang. The first sentence I said when I met Mr. Ye was: "Mr. Ye, I have been using your book for 20 years...", the second sentence was: "My father is also your reader..." Meeting my idol, I was a bit incoherent, and after chatting for more than two hours, I came out of Mr. Ye's house, feeling blissfully happy.

With Mr. Ye Yongchang (June 10, 2009)

During this time, I told him that in the past year, I had personally funded the printing of 5000 copies of "A New English Reading Handbook" through the Shanghai Science and Technology Literature Publishing House. Mr. Ye was very pleased. However, it was only then that I learned that Mr. Ye's "Practical Science and Technology English Reading Handbook" had sold 1.3 million copies, and the author had not received a penny in royalties - a unique decision for a unique era. And Mr. Ye was unaware of the additional 5000 copies that were printed...

After several trips to Tianjin with Xia Qing from Broadview, and after confirming the reprinting details with Mr. Ye, readers were in luck. Starting from March 2010, they could purchase the reprinted "A New English Reading Handbook" published by Wuhan Broadview - it finally saw the light of day again!

## 7. Repeatedly Read At Least One Grammar Book

If a person learns how to use a dictionary, learns how to use a grammar book, and is willing to consult several dictionaries and grammar books, they basically possess the basic qualities to be a teacher in any private English training institution in China. In most short-term English training institutions, the so-called lesson preparation of English teachers, over 90% of the work is nothing more than looking up dictionaries and flipping through grammar books. Such teachers are considered dedicated. Even more so-called "teachers" avoid looking up dictionaries and flipping through grammar books if they can, because they spend 90% of their time and energy on figuring out how to make the classroom atmosphere more lively - singing songs, dancing, telling jokes, and so on. Of course, many people can't even do these things well, so they have to brag, and they can only brag to death...

If readers cherish their time and energy (indeed, it's quite impressive to "regard money as dirt"), it's best to rely on themselves. Only by reading through a grammar book repeatedly as early as possible can one quickly break free from dependence on teachers and become their own mentor. Although grammar knowledge may seem very dry, a change in the reading method could lead to a significant improvement.

The real difficulty in learning a foreign language lies in the non-one-to-one correspondence between the mother tongue and the foreign language. The overlapping, one-to-one corresponding parts of the two languages are easy to learn. Words like "apple-苹果", "table-桌子", "fatigue-疲乏", "sophisticated-精细的", etc., are not difficult to memorize because the concepts they express exist in both languages and correspond one-to-one. However, like the English word "vary", it is difficult to find a corresponding word in Chinese. For example, the word "vary" in this sentence: "People's opinions vary from individual to individual." Using the English-Chinese dictionary's definition of "change" to understand it doesn't seem quite accurate; the meaning of this sentence is "People's opinions differ from person to person." Furthermore, the Chinese adverb "确实" does not have an equivalent function or usage in English. For example, in this sentence "I do hate going out alone.", the structure of adding an auxiliary verb "do" is used to express the meaning of Chinese "确实"; again, in the English sentence "Who could’ve considered such a possibility?", the form "could have done" is used in the interrogative sentence to express the meaning of the Chinese adverb "居然" - rather than the "actually" and "virtually" given in the Chinese-English dictionary.

"Sentences like 'This is a table.' or 'That’s a book.' are not only easy to understand but also easy to use. This is simply because their structure and logic almost correspond one-to-one with our native language. In daily use, nearly 'one-to-one' corresponding texts actually make up the majority, such as the sentence 'Evolution itself has no foresight.' that we have read before. (Readers should have read this sentence in '5.2 You must learn grammar no matter what' —— if not, it means you are not reading carefully enough.)

However, there are many cases where sentence structure and expression methods are not one-to-one between the two languages. Although they are a minority in terms of quantity, they cause a lot of trouble for proficient use of the language. For example, 'Excuse me, is this seat taken?' corresponds to '请问，这个座位有人么？', not 'Please ask, is there anyone at this seat?'; 'If my memory serves, …' might be '如果我没有记错的话……', not 'If I didn't remember wrong, …'

I was deeply impressed by a sentence: 'The impact that technologies have had on our daily life and society in general, is undeniable.' This is a sentence from an article in a college English intensive reading textbook. I was stunned at the time, thinking that if I were to express 'the influence of something', I would probably use 'the influence of something', not the word 'impact', nor a clause, let alone that tense —— it makes sense to think about it, the author is expressing: 'Over time, the impact of technology on ...', where 'over time' is expressed in the present perfect tense. That is to say, there are many places in this sentence where, for me, English does not correspond one-to-one with my native language."

So, I resorted to my usual tricks:

1. I marked the sentence that was "non-corresponding" for me;
2. I copied it into my notebook;
3. Then I thought about whether this sentence could be used as a substitution exercise template - that is, to see if I could turn this sentence into a "fill in the blank" sentence structure:

> The impact that _____ have/has had on _____ , is undeniable.
Afterwards, I could keep using this "template" to make sentences:
* The impact that the internet has had on every aspect of our daily life, is undeniable.
* The impact that parents and their attitudes have had on their children’s personality development, is undeniable.
* The impact that one’s early education has had on his or her later life, is undeniable.
* …

After making a few sentences, this way of expressing was firmly engraved in my mind, and I could use it without thinking (actually, isn't this the way "authentic" should be learned?). And no longer need to consider "Should I use a clause? Or should I use a prepositional structure?" or "Should I use the present perfect tense?" and other questions that must be sorted out with various grammatical concepts. In fact, I have demonstrated similar methods in previous texts: "I have lost my key." This sentence can be used as a template: "I have lost my _____."; and then repeatedly make sentences until this way of expression is familiar to the heart.

So, I suggest the method for students to read through a grammar book is as follows:

1. Browse page by page;
2. Carefully read each example sentence (whether those grammar concepts can be fully understood, whether they can be remembered at once is secondary);
3. Determine whether the English expression of this example sentence is "non-one-to-one" with the Chinese expression? If so, make a mark (if there is a thought of "Ah, if I express this meaning in English, it might not come out like this!", you should make a mark);
4. Accumulate to a certain number, then extract these sentences, make them into replacement exercise templates, repeatedly make sentences and read aloud until proficient;
5. Continue browsing;
6. After reading it once, repeat it several times in this way...

Those grammar concepts are not unimportant, but we don't need to completely solve them all at once like we have obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the repeated browsing process, most of the once difficult concepts will be subtly absorbed and no longer so troublesome. And, it doesn't matter if some concepts are not clear. For example, the concept of "independent subject structure", what does it matter if you don't understand it? As long as you can correctly understand its meaning when you encounter such a sentence (because you have done so many example sentence replacement exercises several times), isn't it okay? Some people have a hard time figuring out the concept of "independent subject structure". After changing a grammar book (such as Collins Cobuild's "Complete English Grammar"), they find that the concept is called another name in these books, so they are in pain...

**Stop thinking, start acting.**
