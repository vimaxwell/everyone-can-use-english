# Chapter 2: Spoken English
## 1. How did I overcome my mute English? I didn't come from a specialized background, so not to mention my poor spoken English, even my pronunciation of words was terribly off. If we go back many years, when I first started teaching TOEFL classes, it wasn't just "poor pronunciation", but rather "simply mispronunciation" (I previously mentioned that I pronounced 'specific' as "spesifik", and 'facade' as "fakeid"). Let alone spoken English - in fact, I hardly ever spoke English with anyone. (But this didn't affect my high TOEFL score at the time, nor did it affect me when teaching reading classes - in fact, my pronunciation wasn't the worst among all the teachers...) Not long after I started teaching, I was asked to teach essay writing classes - later, TOEFL essays, SAT essays, GRE essays, GMAT essays... I've taught all kinds of essays for study abroad exams. In order to score high for myself, I categorized and wrote all the essay topics once, TOEFL has 185 topics, GRE has more than two hundred ISSUE and ARGUMENT topics... Writing by myself is relatively simple, but once I started to teach a large number of students, I immediately found a dilemma: as a teacher, I can't impose my thinking on students, nor should I limit students' thinking with a specific kind of thinking. So, after taking over the task of teaching essay classes, I wrote several versions for a considerable number of topics (for example, for a specific position, write agreeing, disagreeing, and neutral versions)...
So, in the first couple of years after I started teaching essay writing, I was writing and revising essays every day, both my own and my students'. Unconsciously, my mind was filled with countless materials. Up to this point, I still didn't have much experience in spoken English. Personally, I didn't like going to English corners very much, perhaps due to my prejudice, I always felt the efficiency there was too low. Then one day, something unexpected happened. It was on my way back from Guangzhou to Beijing. There was a heavy fog that day, so the flight was delayed. At first, I thought I would just have to wait a little longer, but after more than an hour, I was still in the waiting hall. Out of boredom, I opened my laptop and started revising essays... Suddenly, a voice spoke to me, "Hi..." It was then that I noticed a blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty sitting next to me. I instantly realized that she must have seen me writing in English at length and assumed that I could speak English... But I knew my own shortcomings! My pronunciation was extremely poor, and I made mistakes as soon as I opened my mouth... The woman didn't seem to mind, she just kept talking on her own. My mind was blank, I didn't know what to say, I just forced a smile (probably blushing) and nodded in response. But not speaking at all wasn't an option either! Suddenly, I had an idea. I finally spoke: "Many believe that parents are the best teachers, do you agree or disagree?" - This is the first TOEFL essay question... Perhaps the topic was too abrupt, the woman hesitated for a moment, and her speech actually began to falter. After a few short sentences, she kicked the ball back to me: "Wow, I really didn't think it through, huh, what do you say about it?"
Suddenly, I relaxed - how could she possibly know that I had written four or five versions of this topic! I began to share my views with her. I knew my pronunciation was poor, so I deliberately slowed down my speech... She couldn't help but listen carefully, because she discovered that the unimpressive man sitting next to her, who didn't speak much, would often come up with complex parallel sentences when he did... What's more crucial was that my examples were rich and my logic was rigorous... She thought we were having a discussion, little did she know that for me, this was essentially a presentation! Before I knew it, I had finished speaking, and she said thoughtfully, "Wow, you’re so considerate!" Later on the plane, she even specifically changed her seat, and we chatted about many things along the way, such as, "Small cities are actually more comfortable to live in than big cities", "Why do people like to engage in dangerous activities" (TOEFL topic)... "Every society often overlooks those real thinkers" (GRE topic)... When we arrived in Beijing and were about to part ways, I finally learned that her name was Susan. Later, when I wrote "TOEFL High Score Essays", the team of seven foreign teachers was organized by her. This experience completely changed my view on oral English teaching: I used to always think that the problem for students was "not knowing how to speak" (HOW) - I once thought that was my problem too; now I believe that the problem students face is not just this, what's more important is that they "have nothing to say" (WHAT).
I later developed a habit, no longer hoping to speak off the cuff, but rather to be well-prepared. Whenever I encounter formal occasions where I need to speak English, I always take the time to write a "verbatim script" in advance. If I can't write something, I look it up in the dictionary. If I can't find it in the dictionary, I use Google to search. If even Google can't find it, I think about whether there are alternative ways to say it... Then I spend time revising, familiarizing, and retelling. After all this, when I get to the scene, I can basically handle it "freely". After all this, I realized that this is actually how I speak Chinese. I don't necessarily have to prepare when chatting with friends casually, but when do I not need to prepare in advance for a speech on stage? Sometimes even if I prepare in advance, I might still "bomb" because I'm not prepared enough. In fact, even when chatting with friends, some important content still needs to be prepared (although that preparation is often not "formal"). It's the same for everyone. How many times have you and I ruined a good story because we were not proficient when telling it to friends? * [TOEFL Writing Topics](files/TOEFL-writing-topics.pdf)* [GRE Issue Topics](files/GRE-Analytical-Writing-Argument-Task-Topics.md)* [GRE Argument Topics](files/GRE-Analytical-Writing-Issue-Task-Topics)
For a considerable length of time, I thought I had "discovered" a genuine shortcut, only to realize later that "I was not alone." In China, the best-selling oral English textbooks are actually professional textbooks from Beijing Foreign Studies University, authored by Professor Wu Zhenfu of BFSU: a total of three books, "Elementary Oral English," "Intermediate Oral English," and "Advanced Oral English," which have been reprinted many times over the years, with print runs exceeding 1 million copies each. If readers have the opportunity, you might as well go to the bookstore and flip through this set of textbooks—you will find that most of the topics in the texts may have originated from TOEFL essay topics. Allow me to repeat: **Your problem may not be that you can't speak, but that you have nothing to say.**

## 2. Why can't you find an oral English book that suits you? This is a very strange phenomenon: there are as many books on English speaking as there are hairs on a cow in the market, but as a reader, you always feel that no matter which one you buy, it cannot truly solve your specific problems. Why is this? Because no oral English book is written for you—they are all written for the general public, otherwise, the book could only be sold to you; if that were the case, the book simply couldn't be printed, and no publisher would be willing to publish it. As people age, the connotations of each individual slowly accumulate significant differences, so what people "want to say" varies greatly. There's another reason: in real conversation scenarios, people often avoid "repeating what others have said." Since someone else has already said it, why bother repeating it? At the same time, as time goes on, each person's way of thinking will develop its own uniqueness, to the extent that even if the same opening remarks are used, after a few sentences, it will spread in a completely different direction from others.
随着人们年龄的增长，他们的知识也在增加（希望如此）。因此，人们想要说的话从个体到个体有着巨大的差异。此外，在真实的对话中，人们总是尽可能避免重复他人的话。为什么要浪费时间和精力去做无用功呢？同时，每个人都在变得更加独特，尤其是在思考方式上。因此，一场对话可能以平淡的问候开始，但在几次交流后，肯定会走向一个独特且出乎意料的方向。
The two paragraphs above are typical of my own style of written expression - whether it's "authentic" or not, let's put that aside for now. Think about it, is this what you want to say? Is this the way you would express yourself? Even if you and I think alike, would you ultimately express it like I do? - Whether in Chinese or English... In fact, it's the same for anyone using any language. Despite using the same language, words, and vocabulary, what they ultimately express is vastly different, each unique, and the differences are the majority. And the more one thinks, the more differences there are. This is personal style, whether in writing or speaking, it will bear significant personal characteristics. The same goes for English, so it's normal that spoken English books can't meet your needs. In a sense, this might better explain why children seem to find learning a foreign language easier than adults. Because children have less to say compared to adults, and they have less variation compared to adults. That is to say, the dialogues covered in children's English spoken language textbooks may be able to cover to a greater extent what children want to say, need to say, and might say in the real world. But the content that adults need to express is more complex, so the difficulty of expression is higher. Adults, unlike children, whose words are relatively simple, cannot express their feelings "without thinking", especially those "well-thought-out" contents. The famous "English 900 Sentences" once swept all over China and was considered the most classic spoken language textbook. In a sense, it is indeed; but from another perspective, precisely because "it has selected the most commonly used sentences by all people", those sentences are actually the least spoken by people, or even not spoken at all. Let's take a look at the following content:
1. Hello.
2. Good morning.
3. I am Kate Green.
4. Are you Tom Brown?
5. Yes, I am.
6. How do you do?
7. How are you? Fine, thanks.
8. How is your mother?
9. She is very well, thank you.
10. Good afternoon.
11. Good evening.
12. Good night.
13. Goodbye.
14. See you in the evening.
15. So long.

Having learned all these sentences, they actually don't serve much purpose in real-life oral communication. How could a normal person greet and then say goodbye right after? The real scenario might be like this: there's hardly any small talk when meeting and leaving - because we're not strangers to each other (how often do you talk to strangers in your daily life?), and the content of the conversation varies greatly each time... These oral English books choose those "most frequently repeated contents", but these contents are not as "important because they are the most frequently repeated" as the authors imagined. On the contrary, these most frequently repeated contents actually only cover 1% of the total language use. Therefore, they are bound to be of limited use.
## 3. Poor spoken language skills may have other reasons...
Many people are distressed, and even more, feel inferior because of their poor spoken language skills. However, the deficiency in spoken language might have deeper reasons. It may not be because you're dull, on the contrary, it could be because you're too smart! From a certain perspective, people with simpler minds find it easier to acquire foreign language speaking skills. Because their expression needs are simple. They have simple minds, so when they meet people, they only want to (and can) discuss simple issues, such as, "Nice day, huh?" or "How are you doing?" etc... People with simple minds don't find anything inappropriate when they ask a stranger, "What's your name?" But in reality, please recall how often you need to ask "What's your name?" in the real world. In the real world, the more likely situation is this: 1. Firstly, people who are willing to tell you their names will take the initiative to tell you, and those who are unwilling to tell you their names won't say even if you ask; 2. After the other person tells you their name, the problem you might face is not knowing how to write the specific characters in the name (in English, it's how to spell)... So, a real conversation might go like this: * You say: You are...? * The other person takes over: Li Lei. (Michael Johnson.) * You might need to write down the name, so you continue to say: Lei as in thunder? (Michael as Michael Jordon?)
* The other person says: "Yes." (Correct.)
* You say: "Oh." (OK.)
In reality, perhaps only police officers frequently use the phrase: "What's your name?" Compared to those with simpler minds, those with more complex minds face more difficulties when speaking a foreign language because their expression needs are more complex, and may even be overly complex. They have little interest in discussing the weather or where the other person is from. They want to discuss with the other person "Among the global warming issues that people are currently concerned about, what are the issues that are misunderstood by most people," or "What are the possible risks for ordinary citizens as the RMB exchange rate continues to rise." In short: intelligent people often have complex thinking, and complex thinking needs to be conveyed through complex expressions. Therefore, people with complex minds are destined to face more hidden problems. For example, because the expression needs are too complex, the same training cannot have the same effect on them—they actually need more and stronger training. Another example, they rarely meet people who have the ability to discuss deep issues with them, so they rarely have the opportunity to practice their oral skills in practice—relatively speaking, those with simpler minds are much happier: they can start practicing with anyone they catch... Some people's oral skills are not good not because they are stupid, but precisely because they are not stupid. However, this conclusion does not hold the other way around. Among those who are fluent in spoken language, in addition to a few with simple minds, more people are intelligent. Because speaking itself is a highly coordinated system engineering: it requires continuous input (capturing all feedback from the other party), high-speed processing (the so-called opportunistic action is not so easy), and effective output (it is not easy to speak accurately, correctly, and wonderfully)... All of these require long-term practice and accumulation.
Even when speaking in one's native language, the differences between individuals can be vast. Some people are articulate and have clear, logical thoughts. However, many others may even have unclear pronunciation, confused logic, and incoherent speech... Yet, this is merely the final manifestation of accumulation. In reality, everyone's starting point isn't that different. The emphasis of the above text is to encourage those who are weak in spoken language. In terms of second language acquisition, everyone starts from zero, and no one can reach the pinnacle overnight. Moreover, there's no need to feel inferior if your spoken language is a bit poor, because it doesn't necessarily mean you're stupid or lack talent. It's more likely because you're not stupid, your mind is not simple.

## 4. How to create your own spoken language book?
Therefore, the saying "everything depends on oneself" has never been exaggerated in any field from ancient times to the present. Since you are different from others, those different contents - which are also the most important to you - can only be organized by yourself.

### (1) Be sure to record with a notebook
Prepare a notebook and carry it with you. Spend ten minutes to half an hour every day to record what you want to express in Chinese. After persisting for a while, spend a little more time each day to express those words you want to say in English and record them. Before long, you will find out: 1. In fact, you don't have much to express... 2. Most of these contents, you are completely capable of expressing in English (at most you need to look up a dictionary). In this process, a more important discovery for you might be that your Chinese, that is, your native language, is not as good as you originally thought. Sometimes, what you want to say is not actually fluent.
For instance, a user once asked on a forum, "Could someone please help me translate 'A decision made blindly is usually irrational' into English? Thank you!" Someone quickly responded, "This sentence feels a bit awkward. It's like saying 'Not eating when you're hungry will make you hungry' — if the decision is made blindly, of course it's irrational!" The problem faced by the person asking the question is not just difficulty in expressing in English, but at a deeper level, it's a logical issue, that is, a problem at the level of thought. Due to the lack of rigorous logic, the content they want to express, even when expressed in their native language, is incoherent... (Even if translated into English, it remains a baffling sentence: A blindly made decision is usually irrational.) In fact, this is not a problem unique to any one person. In reality, this kind of implicit problem is very common. This is also why many people find the process of acquiring a second language very challenging — because the crux of the problem is not with the foreign language, but at a more fundamental level: a lack of logical training. However, without self-awareness, one might mistakenly think that the difficulty comes from the foreign language itself; but if the target is misidentified, how can one hit the mark? Therefore, finding a notebook to record what you want to say is not just for future translation into English. Recording has many benefits, at the very least, it allows you to re-examine what you have said, avoiding the possibility that your expression is actually the product of confused thinking.
### (2) What if you have no idea how to express it in English? In a few cases, we may find that we have no idea how to express what we want to say in English. Although these situations are rare, they often involve the most crucial content. In my own accumulation process, I have encountered many situations where I had no idea how to express myself. For instance, once I was listening to music in a bar in Beijing. A foreigner came over wanting to sit in the empty seat while my friend had gone to the restroom. I immediately wanted to say, "This seat is taken!" But I almost got stuck. As I blurted out "There is a person here!" I clearly realized that what I said was essentially a line from a "ghost movie" - there was obviously no one on the seat! The foreigner paused after hearing this, then reacted and said, "OK, I’ll try another one." He then went to find another seat... I took out my notebook, wrote down the Chinese sentence "This seat is taken!", and then, after this Chinese sentence, I also wrote down that "ghost movie line" - "There’s a person here!" and continued listening to the music. A few days later, in another completely unrelated situation, I saw a foreigner encounter the same scenario as me, and she said: "Sorry, it’s taken." I paused for a moment, reacted, then took out my notebook, found the location where I had recorded a few days ago, crossed out "There’s a person here!" and added "It’s (the seat is) taken."
Here's the solution: Regardless of whether it's correct or not, whether it's authentic or not, first find a way to express it. Foreigners are also people, and they are quite intelligent. They will use all possible wisdom to understand your words. Many times, even if your expression is not authentic, not correct, based on the scene at the time, they can guess what you want to express (but even if your expression is wrong, they generally will not point it out, which will mistakenly make you think your spoken language is not bad)... Believing that others have a certain level of intelligence is a manifestation of normal emotional intelligence. Be sure to record it in time. The habit of recording is extremely important. I have spent a lot of space discussing it in "Making Time Your Friend". However, it is regrettable that there are still some readers who think "it's not that serious?" The so-called "stubbornness", let it be. Because there is a record, so in the future when you "accidentally" get the answer, you know where to supplement it. From my practice experience with countless students, if there is a record before, then getting the answer in the future is "inevitable", if there is no record before, many "inevitable" answers will eventually not even "accidentally" form, because you did not record in the past, so when the answer comes, you have never realized it, so the one who passes by is you.

### (3) Learn to "change the way of saying" There are many times when what you want to express does not have a corresponding concept in English. At this time, you must solve it by "changing the way of saying". I have encountered many similar situations. There is a question in the TOEFL writing question, asking "Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools." I want to analyze this topic for students. Among the many reasons why parents may choose a separate school, there is one: they are afraid that their children will fall in love early.
But how do you say "早恋" in English? I don't know. I can't find it. I can't even ask foreigners how to say "早恋", because I can't ask them in English what I want to ask... I described to them: "In our culture, it is deemed as a wrongdoing if teenage girls and boys fall in love..." I originally wanted to ask him "... and we have a specific word to describe the relationship or the circumstance, called '早恋', '早' means too early, or premature, and '恋' means love... is there any counterpart in English vocabulary for this?" But before I could say the rest, the foreigner had already widened his eyes and exclaimed, "Why?" Foreigners won't understand. In their eyes, it's normal, even inevitable, for teenagers to start being interested in the opposite sex (in fact, children start being interested in the opposite sex from a young age). Goethe said, "Which girl does not harbor spring, which boy does not have affection." > The original text is in German, the English translation is: "Whoever is a girl does not want to be loved, and whoever is a boy does not want to be royal to his lover."
In the Western world, there is no equivalent to the Chinese concept of "early love." In Chinese, the term "early love" is a stark phrase—countless teenagers in China commit suicide each year due to issues related to so-called "early love." Therefore, I find it difficult to articulate in English the sentence, "One of the reasons parents choose to send their children to single-sex schools is likely because they fear their children will fall into 'early love.'" However, I managed to jot down the part of the sentence that I could explain: "One of the reasons why many parents want to send their children to separate schools is that they are worried about 'early love.'"

For a long time, I couldn't find an answer. Perhaps a few weeks later, while reading an article, I came across the word "undernutrition." I wondered about the meanings of the prefix "under." So, I looked it up in the dictionary. Ah, it basically has two meanings: 1. Under, as in underground; 2. Insufficient or poor, as in undernutrition, or underage drinking. The moment I read "underage drinking," I suddenly realized that I could explain what I wanted to say without using the term "early love." In fact, what Chinese parents fear is not so-called "early love." If everything happened in thought, they might not actually care. Even if actions occurred due to "early love," such as holding hands or kissing, they might not be too anxious. However, what they truly fear is their children engaging in "underage sexual behaviors."
"One of the reasons why many parents want to send their children to separate schools is that they are worried about possible underage sexual behaviors. The key here is that I had recorded the problems I encountered in the past, so when a potential solution appears - no matter how unimaginable the direction it comes from - I can recall that previous problem, and thus, the problem may be solved.

### (4) Use plain, simple, and non-rhetorical Chinese

This is the most important suggestion: when recording what you want to express, try to avoid any rhetoric. Because in most cases, rhetoric is almost impossible to translate. Each language has its own specific rhetorical methods. For example, in Chinese, we can say 'he is as stupid as a pig...' But if you say in English 'He is as stupid as a pig...' the other person may not understand what you are saying at all. Because in their culture, a pig may symbolize vulgarity and filth, but it does not necessarily symbolize stupidity. On the contrary, they know that pigs are relatively intelligent animals - even in fables, there are often such descriptions: In Animal Farm, it was because the pigs were the smartest that they led the uprising. Our culture often considers pigs to be stupid, largely because of the classic novel 'Journey to the West', where Pigsy ruined the 'generational wisdom' of pigs."
Idioms and colloquialisms are often difficult, if not impossible, to translate. I once saw this sentence in a student's notebook: 

> Even if a person is dressed in a suit and leather shoes, it doesn't necessarily mean that they behave properly.

The idiom "dressed in a suit and leather shoes" is impossible to express in English. "Leather shoes" is easy enough, it's just "shoes". But there is no word for "suit" in English - this is a Chinese term: we saw that the clothes worn by Westerners were different from ours, so we called the clothes they wore "suits". In English, there might actually be a vocabulary counterpart - "Tang suit" or "Han suit". The plain and simple Chinese expression is something like this:

> Even if a person is dressed well, it doesn't necessarily mean that they behave properly.

Since this sentence is already so simple, expressing it in another language is actually very easy:

> Even if one is well dressed, that doesn’t necessarily mean he is decent.

For example, the word "said" in "Confucius said..." is very different from "say". The meaning of "said" is that this is what the ancients said, and often it is what the famous ancients said. If it is said by the ancients, but it is not specified which ancient person said it, we often do not use the word "said", but use "cloud", for example, "the ancients have cloud...".
Therefore, the plain, unadorned, and non-rhetorical expression is not "Confucius said" or "Confucius said," but "Confucius once said..." The word "过" here clearly reminds you to use the past tense of say, said... For example, "Beijing in March, warm and cold..." This kind of poetic expression that depends on the rhythm of Chinese itself (level and oblique tones) can never retain the original meaning after being translated into English. In fact, this simple principle—using plain, unadorned, and non-rhetorical Chinese to record thoughts—is also particularly useful in writing. Many people find English writing difficult, but in fact, that difficulty is set by themselves, because when they express their thoughts, they inadvertently rely too much on the rhetoric of their mother tongue, so much so that it is almost impossible to express those thoughts full of rhetoric in another language. When I was very young, there was an article in the Chinese textbook, "The Last Lesson" by Mr. Alphonse Daudet. It mentions that "when a nation becomes a slave, as long as it keeps its language well, it is like holding the key to open the prison"—this is undeniable; however, when he mentioned that "French is the most beautiful, clearest, and most rigorous language in the world," I asked the teacher, "What about Chinese?" As a result, I was criticized by the teacher for disrupting the class... In fact, every language has its unique, beautiful, and rigorous aspects, and at those specific points, it may even be irreplaceable by any other language. However, this does not mean that just because it is irreplaceable in those aspects, that language is superior to all other languages. This is a simple and clear truth, but it is deliberately ignored by many people. Look around, there are always countless people using "Chinese is irreplaceable" as an excuse for "too lazy to use English", at first glance, it seems to make sense, and even hard to refute, but is this really the case?
### (5) Shouldn't We Think in English? Some students, when they first start "creating their own spoken English book," are very excited. However, after a while, they start to question, "I'm translating like this every day, is this wrong? Do I have to rely on this kind of translation forever? Isn't it said that we should be able to think in English?" In fact, no one needs to translate like this for a lifetime. In reality, during the actual operation process, readers will find that most sentences can be "expressed completely with a one-to-one correspondence." For example, "Coffee, do you want it warm or cold?" This kind of sentence does not require extra effort for most people, just say it directly: "Coffee, warm or cold?" And the few that need to be acquired through accumulation, in fact, are unlikely to be insufficient even after three to five years. It's the notion of "thinking in English" that deserves some serious criticism. For a long time, many English teachers have been instilling in students the concept of "it's best/you must think in English." Regardless of whether the teachers who advocate this have achieved it, it is clear that this is something students cannot do. If "thinking in English" is really as these English teachers advocate, then there is no harm in it; but if "thinking in English" is simply a void concept, or even if it exists, it can be explained or achieved in other more reasonable ways, then the actions of these teachers can only be forgiven if they are out of ignorance. If it is merely to intimidate students, then it is a grave sin.
> Throughout history, there have been many concepts that have been proven to be void and have ultimately disappeared. For instance, around the 17th century, there was a concept called "Phlogiston." At that time, people believed that if an object could burn, it must contain something called "phlogiston" - because people did not yet understand the role of oxygen. Later, science proved that "phlogiston" did not exist at all, so this concept essentially disappeared. Now, apart from articles on the history of science, it is unlikely that this concept will be mentioned. What's more interesting is that psychologists still can't clearly explain why humans need some concepts that are simply fabricated and unnecessary - such as God, the devil, the hymen, and various kinds of ideologies... and so on. In a sense, the so-called "English thinking" (or "British thinking," "American thinking," etc.) in the mouths of English teachers is like the golden cudgel in the hands of English teachers - it can be big, small, long, short, it can hit people when it's big, and cover shame when it's small; and it's like the Tight-Band Spell that only Monk Tang can recite - no one can understand what it is, anyway, only he can recite it, and as long as he recites it, the person who hears it has a headache and aches so much that they can't help but roll on the ground. Let's not talk about whether the suggestion of "must think in English" is really beneficial to students, just raise a question: "Do humans really have to use language to think?" The answer to this question is very important. Because all concepts such as "English thinking" (including "British thinking," "American thinking," "Chinese thinking," "native language thinking," "foreign language thinking," etc.) are based on an important premise, that is, language is a necessity for human thought.
If human thought does not necessarily depend on language, then all these concepts are fabricated and meaningless. We can easily prove that this important premise is clearly false: human thought has never solely relied on language. When there was no language or writing, humans had already survived for at least several million years. For a long period after humans acquired language (a period much longer than the time from the advent of civilization to the present), there was no existence of writing, yet humans were constantly thinking and making judgments. Even in periods without language, humans made many judgments that allowed them to survive and develop through their ability to think. At the same time, they used the same thinking ability to acquire more skills, such as the use of fire, and so on. Since that important premise is false, concepts like "English thinking" are void, or at least "unreliable," because we do not use language to think in most cases. More often, we are thinking about how to express the results of thinking in a specific language, rather than relying on language to get the results of thinking. There is an important paper for readers to refer to: [Absurdity of ‘Thinking in Language’](http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=11) (1972). As a teacher, it is not right to give students a "fabricated and meaningless concept." Especially when many students involuntarily take the concept given by the teacher as their own pursuit. Such students are destined to end in failure - because it does not exist, so it is definitely unattainable. It should be known that those fabricated and meaningless concepts can still play a huge role in the real world - of course, it is usually a negative effect, and in the end, it can only be attributed to "illusion," "distortion," or "self-hypnosis," anyway, none of them will end well.
In fact, in a way that is easy to understand and reasonable, what second language users can truly achieve is to "change the way of expression" through a lot of practice - note, it is not so-called "changing Chinese thinking into English thinking", but just "expressing the same content in a different way". The difference here is mostly in grammatical habits, not subtle, but always intentionally ignored. Fortunately, there are always some people who can understand and quietly bypass the so-called "insurmountable chasm".

### (6) The subtle difference between understanding, expressing, and translating

When many people don't understand a sentence, the way they ask is: "How should this sentence be translated?" In previous articles, I repeatedly mentioned a phenomenon: > The language we use limits our thinking. This wrong question invisibly causes a very serious and intangible obstacle to many English learners (readers should now understand: everyone should not only be a "learner", but should be a "user" from the beginning). First of all, translation is not the purpose of most people learning a foreign language. The purpose of most people learning a foreign language is to use a foreign language, and "translation" is just one of the many uses of a foreign language. However, the question "How to translate this sentence?" inadvertently turns this "one" use into everything, which is the so-called inversion of priorities. Secondly, translation can be divided into at least two types, literal translation and free translation. In fact, in most cases, such a questioner does not realize that what he is actually asking is "How to translate this sentence literally?" In fact, many times, even many sentences that seem very simple are difficult to translate literally, or even impossible to translate. Therefore, the answer to this question is likely to be "I don't know..." The questioner did not soberly realize that he actually asked the wrong question, or at least did not ask accurately enough, and the answerer did not know that what he gave was not the right answer - even though it was a big truth.
For example, this sentence is quite difficult to translate directly:
> We noticed that sometimes we were tempted to **locate** the morality of an act **in** the consequences, in the results, in the state of the world that it brought about.

A student asked this way:
> How to translate *locate the morality of an act in the consequences* in this sentence? Thank you.

In fact, what is more important for English learners (future English users) is "understanding", not "translation". Even if translation is sometimes needed for understanding, what is often needed is "interpretation", not "literal translation".

"Locate the morality of an act in the consequences", if interpreted, is equivalent to "judging the morality of an act by its results". There is unlikely to be a one-to-one correspondence between any two languages (not limited to English and Chinese). We often encounter English concepts that cannot find corresponding Chinese (for example, *serendipity*), or a certain Chinese concept is difficult to find corresponding in English (for example, the head of a large team). At this time, we can't even use "interpretation", we can only use more complicated methods such as detailed explanation, redefinition, or creation of new words...
So, when you encounter a sentence that you can't understand, the correct way to ask might be: "How should I understand this sentence?" or "What does this sentence mean?" Although on the surface, asking like this and "How do you translate this sentence?" may not seem very different, but in reality, they are worlds apart. First, you need to be clear about the purpose of your question (to understand the sentence), and secondly, the person being asked also needs to know how to answer in order to help you understand. Only in this way can effective communication be achieved. Similarly, when we need to express something, we need to consider a possibility: Can the content we want to say be "directly translated" into English - or "can it be directly expressed in English". If it can't, what needs to be done is not to ask others "How do you translate this sentence into English?", but to "rely on yourself to express the same thought in a different way", just as previously explained. Therefore, I suggest that when you ask others questions, in order to get effective responses, please try to avoid using the word "translation". ### (7) Emphasize the collection of "non-intuitive correspondences" The real difficulty in mastering another language (foreign language) lies in mastering the parts that do not overlap with the language you have already learned (mother tongue). Intuitive one-to-one correspondence is actually not difficult: "apple" corresponds to "apple"; "That's a book" corresponds to "That's a book"; "What's this?" corresponds to "What's this?" (Although there is already a slight discrepancy in word order here, it is easy to adapt and therefore difficult to detect)...
The so-called "unidiomatic" expressions are nothing more than using the expression habits of the mother tongue to speak a foreign language. For example:
* If I remember correctly...
* I've never thought about it...
* You actually talk to me like this!
* I knew you had this ability!
* (This) sounds familiar, right?
* I can't remember that name...

These sentences are basically sentences (or fragments) that we must use in our daily life. However, if they are "literally translated", they will be awkward:
* If I didn’t remember wrong…
* I never thought of/that…
* How dare you talk to me like this!
* I know you have such a capability!
* Does it sound familiar?
* I cannot remember that name…

In the same context, the "idiomatic" expressions are as follows:
* If my memory serves, …
* It never occurred to me that…
* Are we really having this conversation?
* Always knew you had it in you!
* Does it ring a bell to you?
* That name eludes me... As for the feeling that some English correspondences are not intuitive enough, this is a subjective matter. Therefore, this kind of collection work can only be done by oneself. What others have organized, basically has little use for oneself (except that people always "feel" or "hope" that what they get is useful). In this regard, one cannot believe or rely on "ready-made-ism", one must do it oneself, accumulate oneself. Previously, I criticized the vague statement of "thinking in English". In fact, those who advocate "thinking in English", their starting point is also to appreciate the importance of this "non-intuitive correspondence". It's just that the prescription they opened was wrong - it's like simply explaining the "inflammation" that may have multiple inflammatory causes as "fire", and what exactly is "fire", and it can't be explained clearly. Now that the root of "not authentic" is known, we know why "100% authentic" is so difficult - all things that need to be obtained through accumulation are difficult, just because most people do not really understand the importance and significance of accumulation. It's easy to know but hard to do. This is also why I used the entire book of "Making Time a Friend" to tell readers the fundamental reason for "everything depends on accumulation". There is no need to pursue "100% authenticity" from the beginning, because that is impossible. But, knowing the importance of accumulation, knowing that it can only be achieved through accumulation, so, you can calmly become "more authentic" through a little bit of accumulation. Even if it's a little bit every day, it's a powerful approach.
In terms of specific practices, the method of collecting these "non-intuitive correspondences" is quite simple. The most straightforward method is to carry a small notebook with you and jot down notes as you encounter them. If you want to be a bit more fancy, you can take advantage of the now ubiquitous portable electronic devices (whether it's a mobile phone or something like an iPad) to record at any time. For those who use a computer (desktop or laptop) as their most used device, creating a dedicated Excel spreadsheet might be the most convenient solution: the spreadsheet only has two columns: Chinese, English, and then you can add to it at any time. ### (8) Long discourses need to be written out in advance. The biggest limitation of most oral books on the market is that they are basically limited to "fragments of speech", not complete discourses - complete discourses are always attributed to the "advanced oral" part. This is not the case. Even a child with simple thinking often expresses his complete thoughts when using language, that is, fragments of speech are definitely not enough. So, whatever you want to say, it's best to write it down in advance. Of course, when you are proficient to a certain extent, in most cases you only need to rehearse in your mind once. However, this "proficiency to a certain extent" may take a long time to achieve. Before you achieve it, don't be bothered: write it out! On this point, I very much agree with Mr. Zhong Daolong's view: "I find that I can't say what I haven't prepared." Isn't everyone like this? Even if it's in your mother tongue, don't you have to be prepared to speak clearly and explain clearly? The so-called "misfortune comes from the mouth", isn't it also caused by not thinking clearly before speaking? (Of course, another reason is the existence of the evil law of "being guilty of speech".)
For every speech I personally deliver, I prepare in advance — even for content I've spoken about many times before. Without fail, any time I don't prepare thoroughly, some sort of mistake inevitably occurs. Therefore, even when telling a joke, it's best to write it out in advance and rehearse it yourself. In fact, every good joke-teller does this — but most people only see the effortless delivery of those who are good at telling jokes, and so they think it's a natural talent and feel inferior. On a daily basis, there are always some people (actually, most people) around us who can ruin even the best jokes; why? Because they didn't prepare! Why don't they improve over a lifetime? Because they attribute their poor performance to "lack of talent" rather than "lack of thorough preparation", so they never understand the importance of preparing in advance, and therefore always rely on "improvisation" when doing anything — little do they know, "improvisation" is a capability that only those who prepare thoroughly in advance might have. 

There was a time when I felt very inferior, always feeling that despite my best efforts, I was not as good as others who seemed to do things casually. Fortunately, there are some areas where others think I "do very well with ease". Looking at these areas, I understand that it's all the same: people just don't see your efforts. When you're not doing well, no one pays attention to you. When you do well, they only see the result. There's a saying in Northeastern dialect: "You only see the thief eating meat, not the thief getting beaten", which is the same principle and very vivid. Later on, after listening to a passage from Mr. Zhong Daolong:
> Some people only see the result of my high level of English proficiency now, without understanding the arduous effort it took to achieve this result. As a result, it's easy to think that I'm smart, with an exceptional memory, and that's why I learned English. In fact, memory is not innate, but a capability acquired through postnatal training. Regarding how I learned English through hard work, I can quote three people to illustrate this point. One was my leader when I was working in Shenyang, who saw me studying English day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep, and said to me, "With the way you study, you're going to move God." Another was a staff member of the China Electronic Equipment System Engineering Company, who always saw me transcribing when she passed by my office on her way to work every day. She was very touched and said, "I have never seen anyone study English as hard as you do." The last one was my wife, who saw me studying English whenever I had free time, with the tape recorder constantly blaring, and said, "Why are you so stupid, you've been studying for so long and you still haven't learned?" Isn't it a good thing for others to say that I'm smart? Why don't I go along with it and say, "Yes! For me, learning English is a very easy thing. When I have time, I listen to tapes, write a bit, and unknowingly, I've learned it," so that others will think that I am indeed smart? Because the truth is not like that. One person who read the initial draft of my "Slow English Entry" said to me, "You shouldn't write out the actual difficulties of self-study in English, but should make it sound easier, so that readers will have the confidence to learn." I didn't take his advice, because the issue of knowledge is a scientific one, and there can be no falsehood. I want to truthfully state the difficulties of self-study, so that readers can be fully mentally prepared.
And so, I came to understand. It's always like this. Where is there anything easy? Even today, I haven't achieved the ability to speak English anytime, anywhere, and as I please. I think I can't do it. I'm still "only able to say, only will say what I've prepared in advance." However, regarding this point, I no longer have any confusion. And for me (I believe it's the same for most people), this is already enough. ## 5. Can we do without a foreign teacher? In summary, the oral language acquisition method I advocate is nothing more than "write down what you want to say first, then practice and revise continuously." But I know people are afraid of writing (even in their mother tongue). There are many reasons for not wanting to write, and some sound extremely reasonable and powerful. Over the years, what I've taught the most is the essay part of the study abroad exam. The hardest part to teach in study abroad exam teaching might be composition (in fact, even in mother tongue language teaching, the hardest part to teach is probably composition, right?), because composition is most likely the part that students practice the least on their own (or even simply don't practice). Even if the teaching is really good, if the students don't practice, the teacher can't play a role; moreover, what most composition teachers teach is basically "clichés" (universal templates, luxury sentence patterns, advanced vocabulary...). Why don't students write essays? Because essays are indeed hard to write. In fact, most people in school avoid writing essays in their mother tongue as much as possible. Why is writing essays so hard? Because writing ability depends more on practice, how can you improve without practicing? Then why don't most people practice? They're lazy. But when preparing for an English exam, people often package their laziness very gorgeously and exceptionally reasonably. They say "I've finished writing the essay and there's no one to correct it, how can I make progress!" They think their idea is too reasonable, and even start to fantasize "If only there was a foreigner to help me correct my essay..."
Here lies the problem. Hoping for a foreigner to correct your essays is unrealistic for 99.99% of English learners in China. China's population is too large; even if all Americans were invited over, it would clearly not be enough. If we brought all of Canada's population to China, it wouldn't be enough for just Shanghai (Canada's population is only equivalent to that of Shanghai - over twenty million). Besides, would inviting foreigners over solve everything? Not necessarily, right? Not every foreigner is literate, not every literate foreigner has a large vocabulary, and not every foreigner with a large vocabulary is cultured (possessing sufficient knowledge reserves and thinking ability). In fact, within China, the so-called foreign teachers, (I guess) more than half are likely just for show, lacking sufficient knowledge reserves, thinking ability, and academic training. The probability of them scoring full marks on a TOEFL essay or SAT, GRE essay is actually very low. The vast majority of these foreign teachers in the United States initially did not have the ability to get into good universities (let alone the possibility of being able to get into graduate school or have the ability to pursue a doctoral degree in the future)... For Chinese students preparing for TOEFL/SAT/GRE, how many of these foreign teachers can be considered qualified? Furthermore, even if some are indeed qualified, so what? The number is so small (definitely a tiny minority), what are the chances that ordinary people like you and me could get their help? And if we really have the chance to meet such a sufficiently qualified foreign teacher, can we really afford the fees (isn't it too much to let such people work for free)? Even if we do meet them and can afford the fees, is our level at the time worthy of such expensive and precious help?
But there's an even more serious problem. Is correction really useful? Do you remember writing essays when you were young? If you think back now, do you truly believe that the corrections made by your primary school language teachers had an irreplaceable and incredibly important impact on your writing skills? An uncomfortable truth is that for most people, the corrections made by their primary school language teachers only brought them humiliation. So how did your writing skills improve (if you indeed have writing skills)? I don't mean to belittle all primary school language teachers, I'm just stating facts — the vast majority of people who eventually possess good writing skills basically rely on themselves: read more, write more, revise more, practice more, observe more, think more, discuss more, accumulate more... And among these things that need to be done more, there's hardly any that a teacher can play a leading role in, almost all are (and can only be) done by oneself. This also explains why some people always wonder "we're all humans, why is there such a big difference?" — what's so strange about that? Some people do "more" of everything in their lifetime, some people don't do "more" of anything, or even don't do anything at all. Looking back now, it's clear that the fundamental reason why many people don't practice English composition is simply because their unrealistic fantasies were not satisfied. Giving up opportunities that could have been achieved by oneself just because unrealistic fantasies cannot be satisfied (in fact, they are bound to be unsatisfied) is nothing but foolishness. There are two more effective methods: 1. Correct your own essays; 2. Help others correct their essays.
Correcting your own essays has an important trick: don't correct immediately after writing, but revise the next day. The reason you wrote that way (even if it's wrong) is because you thought it was right. This inertia is greatest and most pronounced right after you finish writing. Therefore, correcting immediately after writing may not be as effective. It's different after a day, many mistakes almost jump out at you, accompanied by surprise, "Oh my! How could I make such a basic mistake?!" Trust me, this is actually a trace of your real progress—because the most effective means of creating deep memories are nothing more than two: repetition, surprise. Helping others correct essays is one of the fastest ways to improve your own abilities. You might say, "I can't even do it myself, how can I have the ability to help others correct?" This is not a problem, just try it and you'll know, it's much easier to find mistakes than to write essays, especially other people's mistakes, which are easier for you to find. An interesting phenomenon is that the corrector often gains more than the corrected. Because, as an individual, you cannot traverse all possible mistakes—some mistakes you don't make now doesn't mean you won't make them in the future. When you help others correct essays, it's like others are helping you make mistakes, and you are reaping the benefits—and more often than not, you've already achieved "prevention before it happens." ## 6. Self-checklist for things written out, you can refer to the following list for self-correction. This list is important because it lists the mistakes that almost everyone makes most often: * Spelling errors: words are not written according to the correct spelling of the word, but does not include spelling differences brought about by differences between British English and American English.
* Errors in the use of singular and plural forms of nouns: Incorrect use of the number of nouns, including: using the "plural" form of uncountable nouns, using the "plural" form of collective nouns, using singular nouns where plurals should be used (or vice versa), etc.
* Singular countable nouns are not limited: In the sentence, there is no determiner before the singular countable noun, including articles, indefinite pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, noun or pronoun possessives, numerals, and some adjectival possessive pronouns.
* Part of speech errors: In the process of choosing vocabulary, the characteristics of English parts of speech are ignored, and vocabulary is used only according to meaning, resulting in the phenomenon of part of speech usage errors.
* Errors in modification relationships: Violation of the rules of vocabulary modification, adopting inappropriate modification relationships. Including using adjectives to modify verbs, adjectives to modify adjectives, adverbs to modify nouns, etc.
* Collocation errors: In the sentence, there are inappropriate phenomena of vocabulary modification, restriction, explanation, or the wrong use of inherent vocabulary collocation forms.
* Word order errors: The correct and customary expression order is not used to state the content. This includes errors in the order of modifiers, not inverting when inversion should be used, etc.
* Errors in the use of non-finite verbs: Incorrect use of present participles, past participles, or infinitives of verbs. This includes:
    * Misuse of present participles and past participles: The author did not ensure the consistency of the logical subject and the participle, that is, when the logical subject performs an action, the past participle is used, and when it suffers an action or state, the present participle is used.
    * Misuse of infinitives and gerunds: Gerunds express "state, nature, mood, abstraction, regularity, occurrence"; infinitives express "purpose, result, reason, specificity, one-time, will occur".
* Misuse of prepositions: Incorrect use of prepositions.
* Misuse of conjunctions: Incorrect use of conjunctions.
* Misuse of relative pronouns: Incorrect use of relative pronouns in attributive clauses.
* Misuse of articles: The difference between definite and indefinite articles is not clear, or the usage of the two indefinite articles is unclear, resulting in incorrect use of articles.
* Misuse of pronouns or unclear reference: The number or gender of the pronouns used by the author does not match the nouns, or the reader cannot directly determine the object referred to by the pronouns used by the author.
* Incomplete sentences: Some components, especially the main components that make up the sentence, are missing.
* Subject-verb disagreement: The subject and verb of the sentence do not satisfy the agreement in "number".
* Violation of the principle of having only one main clause: When a sentence is composed of multiple clauses to form a complex sentence, the author has not ensured that there is only one main clause, i.e., all subordinate clauses must be guided or isolated by conjunctions, relative pronouns, or semicolons, but there must be a unique main clause. Sentences that commit this kind of error are called "run-on sentences" or "comma splices".
* Errors in comparative sentences: This includes inconsistencies in the comparative subjects in the author's comparative sentences, i.e., in a comparative sentence, the two comparative objects introduced by the author do not have the same essence and attributes, i.e., "incomparable", or errors in the use of comparative degrees, etc.
* Inconsistency in parallel subjects: In parallel components, the author has not achieved complete equivalence in structure, function, and nature between the two sides of the parallel.
* Tense errors: The tense used by the verb in the sentence is inconsistent with the context of the sentence.
* Voice Errors: The voice (active/passive) used by the verb in the sentence is inconsistent with the subject.
* Mood Errors: The sentence does not adopt the correct indicative or subjunctive mood according to the context. In fact, in the actual operation process, the majority of errors made by most Chinese students are two types of errors, singular and plural issues, and tense issues - because Chinese nouns do not distinguish between singular and plural, and Chinese verbs do not have tense. Once these two errors are eliminated, it is equivalent to solving most of the problems. In addition to these two issues, what needs to be noted is the "consistency relationship": subject-verb agreement, main clause and subordinate clause tense agreement, non-finite verb and logical subject active-passive relationship agreement, pronoun reference agreement, parallel structure agreement... The "consistency relationship" is very important, even for native English speakers, they often make such errors (the SAT grammar test has almost only one test point, which is "consistency relationship"). Another important means to avoid errors is to frequently check reference books, and this is the same for anyone - dictionaries and grammar books. The specific usage of reference books will be discussed in detail in later chapters.
* More importantly, it is the ability to think. Language is ultimately used to express thoughts. Therefore, the way of thinking is particularly important. Most people do not know how to think correctly, so that what they want to express is full of loopholes and they do not know it. This problem causes more troubles, and many times it is attributed to the "cultural differences between the East and the West" by some English teachers, which is a vague statement - in fact, this has little to do with culture, but it is a problem of thinking ability. Regarding cultural differences, what is needed first is respect, and what is needed second is understanding. However, the difference in thinking ability is another matter. The content expressed is full of holes, no matter what, it can only be blamed on poor thinking ability, and it has nothing to do with cultural differences.
"One cannot simply 'learn English' alone. This is akin to using a computer for graphic design; merely learning 'Photoshop' is insufficient. One must have adequate training in color theory and basic hand-drawing skills to freely create. There are several books that I recommend for anyone wishing to acquire correct thinking skills and, subsequently, clear expression. 
* 'Thought and Knowledge: An Introduction to Critical Thinking', 4th edition, by Diane F. Halpern
* 'Thinking and Deciding', 4th edition, by Jonathan Baron
* 'Argumentation: The Study of Effective Reasoning' by Zarefsky David (Audiobook)
* 'Craft of Research', by Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams
* 'Good Reasoning Matters!: A Constructive Approach to Critical Thinking', 3rd edition, by Leo A. Groarke, Christopher W. Tindale"
In addition, there are three books on style that are a must-read:
* A Plain English Handbook (1998), from the Security and Exchange Commission, Prefaced by Warren E. Buffett (http://www.plainlanguage.gov)
* On Writing: A Memoir of The Craft by Stephen King (with audiobook)
* Style: Toward Clarity and Grace by Joseph M. Williams

Also, there's a video course from TTC (The Teaching Company) that is the best writing course I've ever seen:
* Building Great Sentences.

## 8 Secret Weapon — Paraphrasing

Almost all truly effective learning methods are simple, inexpensive, often indirect, but genuinely effective. Paraphrasing is such an effective method. Every person in every culture is the same in this regard — for most of their lives, they are paraphrasing what others have said. First of all, language and text are hard to be purely "original", and in most cases, there is indeed no need to be "unique". What's more important is that the goal of second language learners in most cases is not to engage in professions like poets or novelists, but to master another tool for carrying information and communication — in this case, "paraphrasing" almost occupies all of the application of the second language.
This is indeed not as "obvious" as it seems. ETS, after designing and hosting the TOEFL test for decades, only "suddenly realized" to add a large scale of "paraphrasing ability" to the new TOEFL test: The TOEFL writing section has a comprehensive test, requiring candidates to first read an article, then listen to a lecture related to the article just read, and then paraphrase the content of the lecture and how the content of the lecture is connected to the content of the reading article; the speaking section has listening before speaking, reading before speaking, speaking after listening and reading - all are testing the candidate's "paraphrasing ability".

## 9. Seemingly redundant: Actually, even "mute English" is not that bad. For quite a long time, my English was what many people despised as "mute English". But even this has not become a barrier or burden for me to use English. I don't think there is anything scary or strange about mute English. We learn any foreign language in the hope of mastering its listening, speaking, reading, and writing. However, for every person who has been struggling for a long time, it is not as easy as initially imagined to progress in listening, speaking, reading, and writing - this point has already been proven by their own (and countless others') experience. To put it vividly, if you can't speak, you're like a mute, if you can't understand, you're like a deaf person, if you can't read, you're like a blind person; and if you can't write? - Most cultures do not default to the inability to write as a disability. Regardless of whether you can write, let's just talk about mutes, deaf people, and blind people. If you have to become one of these three "disabilities", which one would you choose? I have thought seriously, I would choose "deaf" - because if you are not blind or mute, at least you still retain the channels of input and output. I am most afraid of becoming a "blind person" - because that is the most important means of input, especially because text input accounts for the vast majority of all effective inputs. In a sense, the greatest commonality of learning a foreign language is to add a different information acquisition channel. From this point of view, a mute is much stronger than a deaf person or a blind person, and among the latter two, a blind person is far inferior to a deaf person.
Taking a step back and trying to be as realistic as possible, we find that most people really don't have many opportunities to chat, debate, or argue fervently with foreigners. More often than not, we just need to be "proficient readers." In a sense, we just need "basic vision" - equivalent to having a basic vocabulary and grammatical knowledge - just as a severely nearsighted person with glasses is thousands of times better than a blind person, anyone just needs to pair up with a dictionary and a grammar book to have normal vision. Since we've learned it, the better we use it, the happier we are, which is everyone's normal psychology. But the so-called "good English" is actually hard to have a unified, clear, and meaningful standard. If so, don't mind it, what's the difference between good and bad? Anyway, it has to be used. As you use it, it gets better, no matter how good it is, it's better than before. Or from another perspective, "good enough is good enough." Because "good enough" can start to be used, continuous use has the opportunity and possibility of continuous improvement. My own English pronunciation, although constantly improving, has never been standard, and even has never been "good", at most it is in a "acceptable" state. My vocabulary has never been astonishingly large, don't look at the TOEFL, GRE scores are already very "abnormal" (that is also due to the need to take countless times for professional reasons to reach the level), but when reading English literature in detail on weekdays, I often need to use various electronic dictionaries and online search tools. When writing English articles, the energy spent on deliberation and review is several times that of writing Chinese articles. Before appearing in a situation where only English can be used, you must spend a lot of time and energy to do homework. Experience has proven that otherwise there will definitely be various mistakes.
In fact, my English has never been "good" — even though I've been working in the study abroad test preparation industry for nearly ten years, during which I've taught countless students, many of whom score high or even perfect scores on their study abroad exams each year. I provide college application essay guidance for thousands of high school students every year, and in recent years, I've started to visit the United States at least twice a year to interact with AOs (equivalent to the directors of international student admissions offices at domestic universities)... But this "not good" state has never been a hindrance or burden to my use of English. It's normal to not be good at a foreign language — this is true for everyone. But not being good doesn't mean "can't use" or "shouldn't use". From another perspective, it's precisely because we're not good that we should use it more and diligently. The more we use it, the better we get than before — this is actually a characteristic of all tools. | [< Chapter 1: The Starting Point](./chapter1.md) | [Chapter 3: Phonetics >](./chapter3.md) |
