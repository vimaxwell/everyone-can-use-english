# Chapter 2: Spoken English

## 1. How did I overcome my mute English?

I didn't come from a specialized background, so not to mention my poor spoken English, even my pronunciation of words was a complete mess. Rewinding many years back, when I first started teaching TOEFL classes, it wasn't just "poor pronunciation", but rather "outright mispronunciation" (I previously mentioned that I pronounced 'specific' as "spesifik" and 'facade' as "fakeid"). Let alone spoken English - in fact, I hardly ever spoke English with anyone. (But this didn't affect my high score in TOEFL at the time, nor did it affect my teaching of reading classes - in fact, my pronunciation wasn't the worst among all the teachers...)

Not long after I started teaching, I was asked to teach essay writing classes - later on, I taught TOEFL essays, SAT essays, GRE essays, GMAT essays... I've taught all kinds of essays for various study abroad exams. In order to score high for myself back then, I categorized and wrote all the essay topics once, TOEFL had 185 topics, GRE had more than two hundred ISSUE and ARGUMENT topics each...

Writing on my own was relatively simple, but once I started to teach a large number of students, I immediately found a dilemma: as a teacher, I can't impose my thinking on students, nor should I limit students' thinking with a certain specific thought process. So, after taking over the task of teaching essay classes, I wrote several versions for a considerable number of topics (for example, for a specific stance, I wrote agreeing, disagreeing, and neutral versions)...

So, in the first one or two years after I started teaching composition, I was writing and revising essays every day, both my own and those of my students. Unconsciously, my mind was filled with countless materials.

Up to this point, I still didn't have much experience in spoken English. Personally, I didn't like going to English corners very much. Perhaps it was my prejudice, but I always felt that the efficiency there was too low.

Then one day, something unexpected happened. It was on my way back from Guangzhou to Beijing. There was a heavy fog that day, so the flight was delayed. At first, I thought I would just have to wait a little longer, but after more than an hour, I was still in the waiting hall. Out of boredom, I opened my laptop and started revising an essay...

Suddenly, a voice spoke to me, "Hi......"

It was then that I noticed a blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman sitting next to me. I immediately realized that she must have seen me writing in English and assumed that I could speak English... But I knew my own shortcomings! My pronunciation was terrible, and I made mistakes as soon as I opened my mouth...

The woman didn't seem to mind, and she went on talking about a lot of things. My mind was blank, and I didn't know what to say. I just responded with a smile (probably blushing) and nods.

But not speaking at all wasn't an option either!

Suddenly, I furrowed my brows and came up with a plan. I finally spoke: "Many believe that parents are the best teachers, do you agree or disagree?" - This was the first TOEFL essay question...

Perhaps it was the abruptness of the topic that left the woman momentarily flustered, her speech faltering. After a few short sentences, she passed the ball back to me, "Wow, I really didn't think it through, huh, what do you say about it?"

I suddenly relaxed—how could she possibly know that I had written four or five versions of this topic! I began to share my views. I knew my pronunciation was poor, so I deliberately slowed down my speech... She couldn't help but listen attentively, as she discovered that the unimpressive man beside her, who rarely spoke, would often utter complex parallel sentences when he did... More importantly, his examples were abundant, and his logic was rigorous...

She thought she was having a discussion with me, little did she know, for me, this was simply a presentation!

Before I knew it, I had finished speaking, and she said thoughtfully, "Wow, you’re so considerate!" Later, when we boarded the plane, she even specifically changed her seat. We chatted about many things along the way, such as, "Small cities are actually more comfortable to live in than big cities," "Why do people like to engage in dangerous activities" (TOEFL topic)... "Every society often overlooks the real thinkers" (GRE topic)... It wasn't until we parted ways in Beijing that I learned her name was Susan. Later, when I wrote "TOEFL High Score Essays," the team of seven foreign teachers was organized by her.

This experience completely changed my view on oral English teaching: I used to think that the problem for students was "not knowing how to speak" (HOW) - I once thought that was my problem too; now I believe that the problem students face is not just this, but more importantly, they "have nothing to say" (WHAT).

Later, I developed a habit of not expecting to speak off the cuff, but hoping to be prepared. Whenever I encounter some formal occasions where I need to speak English, I will definitely spend time in advance to write a "verbatim script". If I can't write, I will check the dictionary. If I can't find it in the dictionary, I will use Google to search. If even Google can't find it, I will think about whether there is an alternative way to say it... Then spend time revising, familiarizing, and retelling. After all this, when I get to the scene, I can basically "freely" cope.

After all this, I realized that actually, I speak Chinese in the same way. I don't necessarily have to prepare when chatting with friends in normal times, but which time do I not need to prepare in advance when I go on stage to give a speech? Sometimes even if I prepare in advance, I might "mess up" because I'm not prepared enough. In fact, even when chatting with friends, some important content still needs to be prepared (although that preparation is often not "formal"). We are all the same, how many times have you and I ruined a good story because we were not proficient when telling a story to a friend?

* [GRE Issue Topics](files/GRE-Analytical-Writing-Argument-Task-Topics.md)
* [GRE Argument Topics](files/GRE-Analytical-Writing-Issue-Task-Topics)

For quite a long time, I thought I had "discovered" a real shortcut, only to realize later that "I am not alone". In China, the best-selling oral English materials are actually professional textbooks from Beijing Foreign Studies University, authored by Professor Wu Zhenfu of BFSU: a total of three books, "Elementary English Speaking", "Intermediate English Speaking", and "Advanced English Speaking". They have been reprinted many times over the years, with each edition exceeding 1 million copies. If readers have the opportunity, you might want to flip through this set of textbooks in a bookstore - you will find that most of the topics in the texts may have originated from TOEFL essay topics.

Allow me to repeat: **Your problem may not be that you can't speak, but that you have nothing to say.**

## 2. Why can't you find a suitable oral English book?

This is a very strange phenomenon: there are countless books on English speaking on the market, but as a reader, you always feel that no matter which one you buy, it can't really solve your specific problems.

Why is that?

Because no oral English book is written for you - they are all written for the general public. Otherwise, the book could only be sold to you; if that were the case, the book simply wouldn't be printed, as no publisher would be willing to publish it.

As individuals age, their depth of understanding gradually accumulates, leading to vast differences. Consequently, what each person "wants to say" varies greatly. Another factor is that in real conversation scenarios, people often avoid "repeating what others have said" unless necessary. After all, why bother to reiterate what has already been expressed by others? Simultaneously, as time progresses, everyone's way of thinking evolves uniquely. Even if the conversation starts with the same pleasantries, it will diverge into a completely different direction after a few exchanges.

As people mature, their knowledge base also expands (hopefully). Therefore, the topics that people wish to discuss can drastically differ from one person to another. Moreover, in actual conversations, people tend to avoid repeating others unless it's necessary. Why expend time and energy to echo the same sentiments?

In the meantime, everyone becomes increasingly distinctive, particularly in terms of their thought processes. Hence, a conversation might commence with commonplace greetings, but it's bound to veer off into a unique and unexpected trajectory after a few exchanges.

The two paragraphs above are typical of my own style of written expression - whether it's "authentic" or not is another matter. Think about it, is this what you want to say? Is this the way you would express yourself? Even if you and I think alike, would you express it in the same way as I do? - Whether in Chinese or English...

In fact, it's the same for anyone using any language. Despite using the same language, characters, and vocabulary, what they ultimately express is vastly different, unique, and the differences outweigh the similarities. And the more one thinks, the more differences there are. This is personal style, whether in writing or speaking, it will bear significant personal characteristics. The same goes for English, so it's normal that a spoken English book can't meet your needs.

In a sense, this might better explain why children seem to find learning a foreign language easier than adults. Because children have less to say compared to adults, and there is less variation among them. That is to say, the dialogues covered in children's English speaking textbooks may be able to cover to a greater extent what children want to say, need to say, and might say in the real world. But adults need to express more complex content, so the difficulty of expression is higher. Adults, unlike children, can't express their feelings, especially those "well-thought-out" contents, without thinking.

The famous "English 900 Sentences" once swept across China and was considered the most classic spoken English textbook. In a sense, it is; but from another perspective, precisely because "it has selected the most commonly used sentences by all people", those sentences are actually the least spoken, or even not spoken at all by people. Let's take a look at the following content:

1. Hello.
2. Good morning.
3. I am Kate Green.
4. Are you Tom Brown?
5. Yes, I am.
6. How do you do?
7. How are you? Fine, thanks.
8. How is your mother?
9. She is very well, thank you.
10. Good afternoon.
11. Good evening.
12. Good night.
13. Good-bye.
14. See you in the evening.
15. So long.

Once you've learned all these sentences, they're actually not much use for real spoken communication. How could a normal person greet and then say goodbye right after meeting? The real scenario might be like this: there's no small talk at the time of meeting and leaving — because we're not strangers to each other (how often do you talk to strangers in your daily life?), and the content of the conversation varies greatly each time...

These spoken English books choose those "most frequently repeated contents", but these contents are not as "important because they are the most frequently repeated" as the authors imagined. On the contrary, these most frequently repeated contents actually only cover 1% of the total language use. So, it's destined to be of limited use.

## 3. Poor Spoken Language Skills May Have Other Reasons...

Many people are distressed, and even more, feel inferior because of their poor spoken language skills. However, the deficiency in spoken language might have deeper reasons. It's not because you're stupid, on the contrary, it might be because you're too smart!
From a certain perspective, people with simpler minds find it easier to acquire foreign language speaking skills. Because their expression needs are simple. They have simple minds, so when they meet people, they only want to (and can) discuss simple issues, such as, "Nice day, huh?" or "How are you doing?" and so on...

People with simple minds don't find anything wrong with asking a stranger, "What's your name?" But in reality, think about how often you need to ask, "What's your name?" in the real world.

In the real world, the more likely scenarios are:

1. Firstly, those who are willing to tell you their names will take the initiative to do so, and those who are unwilling to tell you their names won't say even if you ask;
2. After the other person tells you their name, the problem you might face is not knowing how to write (or spell in English) the specific characters in the name...

So, a real conversation might go like this:

* You say: You are...? (You are …?)
* The other person takes over: Li Lei. (Michael Johnson.)
* You might need to write down the name, so you continue to say: Lei as in thunder? (Michael as in Michael Jordon?)
* The other person says: Yes. (Correct.)
* You say: Oh. (OK.)

In fact, in the real world, perhaps only the police often use this phrase: "What's your name?"

Compared to those with simple minds, those with complex minds face more difficulties when speaking a foreign language because their expression needs are more complex, and may even be overly complex. They are not particularly interested in discussing the weather with the other person, or where the other person comes from. They want to discuss with the other person "Among the global warming issues that people are currently concerned about, what are the issues that are misunderstood by most people", or "What are the possible risks for ordinary citizens as the RMB exchange rate continues to rise"...

In short: intelligent people often have complex thinking, and complex thinking needs to be conveyed through complex expressions.

Therefore, people with complex minds are destined to face more hidden problems.

For example, because the expression needs are too complex, the same training cannot play the same role on them - they actually need more and stronger training. For example, they rarely meet people who have the ability to discuss deep issues with them, so they rarely have the opportunity to practice their oral skills in practice - in contrast, those with simple minds are much happier: they can start practicing with anyone...

Some people's oral language is not good not because they are stupid, but precisely because they are not stupid. However, this conclusion does not hold the other way around. Among those who are fluent in spoken language, in addition to a few with simple minds, more people are intelligent. Because speaking itself is a highly coordinated system engineering: it requires continuous input (capturing all feedback from the other party), high-speed processing (the so-called opportunistic action is not so easy), and effective output (it is not easy to speak accurately, correctly, and wonderfully)... All of these require long-term exercise and accumulation.

Even when speaking in one's native language, the differences between individuals can be vast. Some people are articulate and have clear, logical thinking. Yet, many others may even have unclear pronunciation, disorganized logic, and incoherent speech... However, this is merely the final manifestation of accumulation. In reality, there isn't much difference in everyone's starting point.

The emphasis of the above text is to encourage those who are not good at speaking. In terms of second language acquisition, everyone starts from zero, and no one can reach the pinnacle overnight. Moreover, there's no need to feel inferior if your spoken language is a bit poor. It doesn't necessarily mean you're stupid or lack talent. More likely, it's because you're not stupid; your mind is not simple.

## 4. How to Create Your Own Spoken Language Book?

Therefore, the saying "everything depends on oneself" has never been exaggerated in any field from ancient times to the present. Since you are different from others, those different contents - which are also the most important to you - can only be organized by yourself.

### (1) Be Sure to Record in a Notebook

Prepare a notebook and carry it with you. Spend ten minutes to half an hour each day recording what you want to express in Chinese. After persisting for a while, spend a little more time each day expressing those things you want to say in English and record them.

Before long, you will find:

1. In fact, you don't have much to express...
2. Most of the content you can actually express in English (at most, you need to check the dictionary).

In this process, a more important discovery for you might be that your Chinese, that is, your native language, is not as good as you originally thought. Sometimes, what you want to say is not fluent.

For instance, there was once a user on a forum who asked, "Could someone please help me translate 'A decision made blindly is usually irrational' into English? Thank you!"

Soon, someone responded, "This sentence feels a bit awkward. It's like saying 'Not eating when you're hungry will make you starve' — if the decision is made blindly, of course it's irrational!"

The problem faced by the person who asked the question is not just difficulty in expressing themselves in English. On a deeper level, it's a logical problem, a problem with their thinking. Because their logic is not rigorous, the content they want to express, even when expressed in their native language, is incoherent... (Even if it's translated into English, it's still a nonsensical sentence: A blindly made decision is usually irrational.)

In fact, this is not a problem unique to any one person. In reality, this kind of implicit problem is very common. This is also why many people find the process of acquiring a second language very challenging — because the crux of the problem is not with the foreign language, but at a more fundamental level: a lack of logical training. However, without self-awareness, one might mistakenly think that the difficulty comes from the foreign language itself; but if you're aiming in the wrong direction, how can you hit the target?

Therefore, find a notebook and record what you want to say, not just for the sake of translating it into English in the future. Recording it has many benefits, at least, it allows you to re-examine what you've said, to avoid the possibility that your expression is actually the product of confused thinking.

### (2) What if you don't know how to express it in English?

In a few cases, we may find that what we want to express, we have no idea how to express it in English. Although these situations are rare, they often tend to be the most critical content.

In my own accumulation process, I have encountered many situations where I didn't know how to express it at the time. For example, once, I was listening to music in a bar in Beijing. A friend next to me got up to go to the bathroom, and a foreigner came over, wanting to sit in that empty seat, and I immediately wanted to express "This seat is taken!"

But, I almost got stuck. As I blurted out "There is a person here!" I clearly realized that what I said was simply a line from a "ghost movie" - there is clearly no one on the seat! The foreigner heard it, was stunned for a moment, then reacted and said, "OK, I’ll try another one." Then he went to find another seat...

I took out a notebook, wrote down this Chinese sentence "This seat is taken!", and then, after this Chinese sentence, I also wrote down that "ghost movie line" - "There’s a person here!" and then continued to listen to the music.

A few days later, in another completely unrelated situation, I saw a foreigner encounter the same scene as me, and then she said: "Sorry, it’s taken." I was stunned for a moment, reacted, then took out the notebook, found the position recorded a few days ago, crossed out "There’s a person here!" and added "It’s (the seat is) taken."

Here is the translation:

This is the solution:

Regardless of whether it's right or not, whether it's authentic or not, first find a way to express it.

Foreigners are also people, and they are quite intelligent. They will use all possible wisdom to understand your words. Many times, even if your expression is not authentic, not correct, based on the scene at the time, they can guess what you want to express (but even if your expression is wrong, they generally will not point it out, which will mistakenly make you think your spoken English is not bad)... Believing that others have a certain level of intelligence is a manifestation of normal emotional intelligence.

Be sure to record it in time. The habit of recording is extremely important. I have spent a lot of space discussing it in "Making Time a Friend". However, it is regrettable that there are still some readers who think "Isn't it necessary?" The so-called "stubbornness", so be it.

Because there is a record, so in the future when you "accidentally" get the answer, you know where to supplement it. From my practice experience with countless students, if there is a record before, then getting the answer in the future is "inevitable". If there is no record before, many "inevitable" answers will eventually not even "accidentally" form, because you did not record in the past, so when the answer comes, you have never realized it, so what you missed is you.

### (3) Learn to "change the way of saying"

Many times, what you want to express does not have a corresponding concept in English. At this time, you must solve it by "changing the way of saying".

I have encountered many similar situations. There is a question in the TOEFL writing topic, asking "Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools." I want to analyze this topic for students. Among the many reasons why parents may choose a separate school, one is: they are afraid that their children will fall in love early.

But how do you say "early love" in English? I don't know. I can't find it. I can't even ask foreigners how to say "early love" because I can't ask them in English what I want to ask...

I described to them, "In our culture, it is considered a wrongdoing if teenage girls and boys fall in love..." I originally wanted to ask him "... and we have a specific word to describe the relationship or the circumstance, called 'early love', 'early' means too early, or premature, and 'love' means love... is there any counterpart in English vocabulary for this?" But before I could finish, the foreigner had already widened his eyes and exclaimed, "Why?"

Foreigners won't understand. In their eyes, it's perfectly normal, even inevitable, for teenagers to start showing interest in the opposite sex (in fact, children start showing interest in the opposite sex from a young age). Goethe said, "Which girl does not yearn for love, which boy does not have affection?"

> The original text is in German, the English translation is: "Whoever is a girl does not want to be loved, and whoever is a boy does not want to be royal to his lover."

In the Western world, there is no equivalent to the Chinese concept of "early love." In Chinese, the term "early love" is a stark phrase - the number of teenagers who commit suicide each year in China due to so-called early love issues is incalculable...

Therefore, "One of the reasons why parents choose to send their children to single-sex schools is likely because they fear their children will fall into 'early love.'" This sentence, I simply couldn't articulate in English. However, I still jotted down the parts of this sentence that I could explain:

> One of the reasons why many parents want to send their children to separate schools is that they are worried about 'early love.'

For a long time, I couldn't find the answer.

Perhaps a few weeks later, one day while reading an article, I came across the word "undernutrition" (malnutrition), and a thought flashed through my mind: what does the prefix "under" mean? So, I looked it up in the dictionary. Oh, it basically has two meanings:

1. Underneath... like underground;
2. Insufficient, poor, like undernutrition, like underage drinking...

The moment I read "underage drinking" (underage drinking), I suddenly realized that I could explain what I wanted to say without using the word "early love." In fact, what Chinese parents fear is not so-called "early love." If everything happens in thought, they probably don't really care, even if actions occur due to "early love," like holding hands, kissing, they probably wouldn't be too nervous; however, what they truly fear is their children engaging in "underage sexual behaviors"...

"One of the reasons why many parents want to send their children to separate schools is that they are worried about possible underage sexual behaviors.

The key here is that I had recorded the problems I encountered in the past. So, when a potential solution appears - no matter how unimaginable the direction it comes from - I can recall that previous problem, and thus, the problem might be solved.

### (4) Use plain, simple, and non-rhetorical Chinese

This is the most important suggestion: when recording what you want to express, try to avoid any rhetoric. Because in most cases, rhetoric is almost impossible to translate.

Every language has its own specific rhetorical methods. For example, in Chinese, we can say "he is as stupid as a pig..." But if you say in English "He is as stupid as a pig..." the other person might not understand what you're saying at all.

Because, in their culture, a pig might symbolize being low-class, dirty, but not necessarily stupid. It might even be the opposite, they know that pigs are relatively intelligent animals - even in fables, there are often such descriptions: In Animal Farm, it was because the pigs were the smartest, so they led the uprising. The reason our culture often thinks pigs are stupid is largely due to the classic novel "Journey to the West", where Pigsy ruined the "generations of wisdom" of pigs."

Idioms and proverbs are often difficult, if not impossible, to translate. I once saw this sentence in a student's notebook:

> Even if a person is dressed in a suit and leather shoes, it doesn't necessarily mean that his behavior is proper.

The idiom "dressed in a suit and leather shoes" is impossible to express in English. "Leather shoes" is easy enough, it's just "shoes". But there is no word for "suit" in English - this is a term used by Chinese people. When we see that the clothes worn by Westerners are different from ours, we call that type of clothing a "suit". In English, there might actually be a vocabulary counterpart - "Tang suit" or "Han suit".

The plain and simple Chinese expression would be something like this:

> Even if a person is dressed very well, it doesn't necessarily mean that his behavior is proper.

Since this sentence is already so simple, expressing it in another language is actually very easy:

> Even if one is well dressed, it doesn't necessarily mean he is decent.

For example, the word "said" in "Confucius said..." is very different from "say". The meaning of "said" is that this is something said by an ancient person, and often a famous ancient person. If it is something said by an ancient person, but it is not specified which ancient person said it, we often do not use the word "said", but use "cloud", for example, "the ancients have cloud...".

So, the plain, simple, and non-rhetorical expression is not "Confucius said" or "Confucius said," but "Confucius once said..." The word "said" in this sentence clearly reminds you to use the past tense of say...

For example, "Beijing in March, warm and cold..." This kind of poetic expression that depends on the rhythm of Chinese itself (level and oblique tones) can never retain the original meaning after being translated into English.

In fact, this simple principle—using plain, simple, and non-rhetorical Chinese to record thoughts—is also particularly useful in writing. Many people find English writing difficult, but in fact, that difficulty is set by themselves, because when they express their thoughts, they inadvertently rely too much on the rhetoric of their mother tongue, so much so that it is almost impossible to express those thoughts full of rhetoric in another language.

When I was very young, there was an article in the Chinese textbook, Mr. Alphonse Daudet's "The Last Lesson." It mentioned that "when a nation becomes a slave, as long as it keeps its language well, it is like holding the key to open the prison"—this is undeniable; however, when he mentioned that "French is the most beautiful, clear, and rigorous language in the world," I asked the teacher, "What about Chinese?" As a result, the teacher criticized me for making trouble in class...

In fact, every language has its unique, beautiful, and rigorous aspects, and at those specific points, it may even be irreplaceable by any other language. However, this does not mean that just because it is irreplaceable in those aspects, that language is superior to all other languages. This is a simple and clear truth, but it is deliberately ignored by many people. Look around, there are always countless people using "Chinese is irreplaceable" as an excuse for "too lazy to use English", at first glance, it seems to make sense, and even hard to refute, but is this really the case?

### (5) Shouldn't We Think in English?

Some students, when they first start "creating their own spoken English book," are very excited. However, before long, they begin to question, "I'm translating like this every day, is this wrong? Do I have to rely on this kind of translation forever? Isn't it said that we should be able to think in English?"

In fact, no one needs to translate like this for a lifetime. In reality, during the actual operation process, readers will find that most sentences can be "expressed completely with a one-to-one correspondence." For example, the sentence "Coffee, do you want it warm or cold?" doesn't require any extra effort for most people, they can just say it directly: "Coffee, warm or cold?" And the few that need to be acquired through accumulation, in fact, are unlikely to still be insufficient after three to five years.

However, the notion of "thinking in English" deserves some serious criticism.

For a long time, many English teachers have been instilling in students the concept that "it's best/essential to think in English." Regardless of whether the teachers who advocate this have achieved it, it's clear that this is something students cannot do. If "thinking in English" is really as these English teachers proclaim, then there's no harm in it; but if "thinking in English" is simply a void concept, or even if it exists, it can be explained or achieved in other more reasonable ways, then the actions of these teachers can only be forgiven if they are out of ignorance. If it's merely to intimidate students, then it's utterly reprehensible.

> Throughout history, there have been many concepts that have been proven to be void and ultimately disappeared. For instance, around the 17th century, there was a concept called "Phlogiston". At that time, people believed that if an object could burn, it must contain something called "phlogiston" - because people did not yet understand the role of oxygen. Later, science proved that "phlogiston" did not exist at all, so this concept essentially disappeared. Now, apart from articles on the history of science, it is unlikely that this concept will be mentioned. What's more interesting is that psychologists still can't clearly explain why humans need some concepts that are simply fabricated and unnecessary - such as God, the devil, the hymen, and various kinds of ideologies... and so on.

In a sense, the so-called "English thinking" (or "British thinking", "American thinking", etc.) in the mouths of English teachers is like the golden cudgel in the hands of English teachers - it can be big, small, long, short, big enough to hit people, small enough to cover shame; and it's like the Tight-Band Spell that only Monk Tang can recite - no one can understand what it is, anyway, only he can recite it, and as long as he recites it, the person who hears it has a headache and pain that makes them want to roll on the ground.

Let's not talk about whether the suggestion of "must think in English" is really beneficial to students, just raise a question: "Do humans really have to use language to think?"

The answer to this question is very important. Because all concepts such as "English thinking" (including "British thinking", "American thinking", "Chinese thinking", "native language thinking", "foreign language thinking", etc.) are based on an important premise, that is, language is a necessity for human thought.

If human thought does not necessarily rely on language, then all these concepts are fabricated and meaningless. And it's easy for us to prove that this important premise is clearly false: human thought has never relied solely on language. When there was no language or writing, humans had already survived for at least several million years. For a long period after humans acquired language (a period much longer than the time from the advent of civilization to the present), there was no existence of writing, yet humans were constantly thinking and making judgments. Even in periods without language, humans made many judgments that allowed them to survive and develop through their ability to think. At the same time, they used the same thinking ability to acquire more skills, such as the use of fire, and so on.

Since that important premise is false, concepts like "English thinking" are void, or at least "unreliable," because we do not use language to think in most cases. More often, we are thinking about how to express the results of thinking in a specific language, rather than relying on language to get the results of thinking.

There is an important paper for readers to refer to: [Absurdity of ‘Thinking in Language’](http://www.dwillard.org/articles/artview.asp?artID=11) (1972)

As a teacher, it is unkind to give students a "fabricated and meaningless concept". Especially when many students involuntarily take this concept given by the teacher as their own pursuit. Such students are destined to end in failure - because it does not exist, so it is definitely unattainable. It should be known that those fabricated and meaningless concepts can still play a huge role in the real world - of course, it is usually a negative effect, and in the end, it can only be attributed to "illusion", "distortion", or "self-hypnosis", anyway, none of them can end well.

In fact, in a way that is easy to understand and reasonable, what second language users can truly achieve is to "change the way of expression" through a lot of practice - note, it is not the so-called "changing Chinese thinking into English thinking", but just "expressing the same content in a different way". The difference here is mostly in grammatical habits, which are not subtle, but are often deliberately ignored. Fortunately, there are always some people who can understand and quietly bypass the so-called "insurmountable chasm".

### (6) The subtle differences between understanding, expressing, and translating

When many people don't understand a sentence, the way they ask is: "How should this sentence be translated?"

In previous articles, I repeatedly mentioned a phenomenon:

> The language we use limits our thinking.

This wrong question has invisibly caused a very serious and intangible obstacle to many English learners (readers should now understand: everyone should not only be a "learner", but should be a "user" from the beginning).

First of all, translation is not the purpose of most people learning a foreign language. The purpose of most people learning a foreign language is to use a foreign language, and "translation" is just one of the many uses of foreign languages. However, the question "How to translate this sentence?" has inadvertently turned this "one" use into everything, which is the so-called inversion of priorities.

Secondly, translation can be divided into at least two types, literal translation and free translation. In fact, in most cases, such a questioner does not realize that what he is actually asking is "How to translate this sentence literally?" In fact, many times, even many sentences that seem very simple are difficult to translate literally, or even impossible to translate literally. Therefore, the answer to this question is likely to be "I don't know..." The questioner did not soberly realize that he actually asked the wrong question, or at least did not ask accurately enough, and the answerer did not know that what he gave was not the right answer - even though it was a big truth.

For example, this sentence is quite difficult to translate directly:

> We noticed that sometimes we were tempted to **locate** the morality of an act **in** the consequences, in the results, in the state of the world that it brought about.

The student's question was this:
> How do you translate *locate the morality of an act in the consequences* in this sentence? Thank you.

In fact, what's more important for English learners (future English users) is "understanding," not "translation." Even when translation is sometimes needed for understanding, what's often needed is "interpretation," not "literal translation." "Locate the morality of an act in the consequences," when interpreted, is equivalent to "judging the morality of an action by its results."

Between any two languages (not limited to English and Chinese), it's unlikely that there's a one-to-one correspondence everywhere. We often encounter English concepts that can't be found in Chinese (for example, *serendipity*), or a Chinese concept that's hard to find in English (for example, the head of a large team). At this time, we can't even rely on "interpretation," but have to resort to more complicated methods such as detailed explanations, redefinitions, or creating new words...

So, when you encounter a sentence that you can't understand, the most correct way to ask might be: "How should I understand this sentence?" or "What does this sentence really mean?"

Although on the surface, asking in this way seems not much different from "How is this sentence translated?", but in reality, there is a world of difference. First, you clearly know what the purpose of your question is (to understand the sentence), and secondly, the person being asked also clearly knows how to answer in order to make the questioner understand. Only in this way can communication be effective.

The same logic applies when we need to express ourselves. We need to judge a possibility: Can the content we want to say be "directly translated" into English - or "can it be directly expressed in English". If it can't, what needs to be done is not to ask others "How is this sentence translated into English?", but to "rely on oneself to express the same thought in a different way", just as previously explained.

Therefore, I suggest that when you ask others, in order to get an effective response, please try to avoid the word "translation".

### (7) Focus on Collecting "Non-Intuitive Correspondences"

Mastering another language (foreign language), the real difficulty lies in mastering the non-overlapping parts with the learned language (mother tongue). Intuitive one-to-one correspondence is actually not difficult: "apple" corresponds to "apple"; "That's a book" corresponds to "That’s a book"; "What’s this?" corresponds to "What’s this?" (Although there is already a slight discrepancy in word order here, it is easy to adapt and therefore difficult to detect)...

What we call "unnatural" is nothing more than using the expression habits of our mother tongue to speak a foreign language. For example:

* If I remember correctly...
* I've never thought about...
* You actually talk to me like this!
* I knew you had this ability!
* Does this sound familiar?
* I can't remember that name...

These sentences are basically sentences (or fragments) that we must use in our daily life. However, if they are "translated directly", they will be awkward:

* If I didn't remember wrong...
* I never thought of/that...
* How dare you talk to me like this!
* I know you have such a capability!
* Does it sound familiar?
* I cannot remember that name...

In the same context, the "natural" expressions are like this:

* If my memory serves, ...
* It never occurred to me that...
* Are we really having this conversation?
* Always knew you had it in you!

* Does that ring a bell?
* That name eludes me...

As for the feeling that some Chinese-English correspondences are not intuitive enough, this is a subjective matter, so this kind of collection work can only be done by oneself. What others have compiled is basically not very useful to oneself (except that people always "feel" or "hope" that what they get is useful). In this regard, you cannot believe in or rely on "ready-made solutions", you must do it yourself, accumulate on your own.

Previously, I criticized the vague statement of "thinking in English". In fact, those who advocate "thinking in English" also start from realizing the importance of this "non-intuitive correspondence". However, the prescription they gave was wrong - this is like simply explaining the "inflammation" that may have multiple inflammatory causes as "fire", and what "fire" is, they can't explain clearly.

Now that the root cause of "not being authentic" is known, it is known why it is so difficult to be "100% authentic" - everything that needs to be obtained through accumulation is difficult, just because most people do not really understand the importance and significance of accumulation. It's easy to know but hard to act. This is also why I used the entire book "Treat Time as a Friend" to tell readers that "everything depends on accumulation".

There is no need to pursue "100% authenticity" from the beginning, because that is impossible. However, knowing the importance of accumulation, knowing that it can only be achieved through accumulation, therefore, you can become "more authentic" bit by bit through accumulation without being anxious or impatient. Even if it's a little progress every day, it's a powerful approach.

In terms of specific practices, the method of collecting these "non-intuitive correspondences" is quite simple. The most straightforward method is to carry a small notebook with you and jot down notes as you encounter them. If you want to be a bit more fancy, you can take advantage of the now ubiquitous portable electronic devices (whether it's a mobile phone or something like an iPad) to record at any time. For those who use a computer (desktop or laptop) as their most used device, creating a dedicated Excel spreadsheet might be the most convenient solution: the spreadsheet only has two columns: Chinese, English, and then you can add to it at any time.

### (8) Long discourses should be written out in advance

The biggest limitation of most spoken language books on the market is that they are basically limited to "phrases", not complete discourses - complete discourses are always attributed to the "advanced spoken language" part. This is not the case, even a child with simple thinking often expresses his complete thoughts when using language, that is, phrases are definitely not enough.

So, whatever you want to say, it's best to write it down in advance. Of course, when you are proficient to a certain extent, in most cases you only need to rehearse it in your mind. However, this "proficient to a certain extent" may take a long time to achieve. Before you achieve it, don't be bothered: write it out!

On this point, I very much agree with Mr. Zhong Daolong's view: "I find that I can't say what I haven't prepared." Isn't everyone like this? Even if it's in your mother tongue, don't you also need to be prepared to speak clearly and explain clearly? The so-called "misfortune comes from the mouth", isn't it also caused by not thinking clearly before speaking? (Of course, another reason is the existence of the evil law of "punishment for speech".)

For every speech I give personally, I always prepare in advance - even if it's content I've delivered many times before. Without sufficient preparation, there will inevitably be some sort of mistake, without exception.

Therefore, even if it's just a joke, it's best to write it out in advance and then rehearse it yourself. In fact, every good joke-teller does this - but most people only see the effortless delivery of those who are good at telling jokes, and so they think it's a natural talent and feel inferior. On a daily basis, there are always some people around (actually, most people) who can ruin even the best jokes; why? Because they haven't prepared! Why haven't they improved in their lifetime? Because they attribute their poor performance to "lack of talent" rather than "lack of thorough preparation", so they never understand the importance of preparing in advance, and therefore always rely on "improvisation" when doing anything - little do they know, "improvisation" is a capability that only those who prepare thoroughly in advance might have.

There was a time when I felt very inferior. I always felt that despite my best efforts, I couldn't do as well as others who seemed to do things casually. Fortunately, there are some areas where others think I "do very well with ease". Looking at these areas, I understand that it's all the same: people don't see your efforts. When you're not doing well, no one pays attention to you. When you do well, they only see the result. There's a saying in Northeastern dialect: "You only see the thief eating meat, not the thief getting beaten", which is the same principle, very vivid.
Later on, I heard a piece of advice from Mr. Zhong Daolong:

> Some people only see the result of my current high level of English proficiency, without understanding the arduous effort it took to achieve this. As a result, it's easy for them to think that I'm smart, with an exceptional memory, and that's why I've mastered English. In reality, memory is not innate, but a capability acquired through practice. To illustrate how I learned English through hard work, I can quote three people. One was my leader when I was working in Shenyang, who saw me studying English tirelessly day after day, and said to me, "With the way you study, you're going to move God." Another was a staff member of the China Electronic Equipment System Engineering Company, who always saw me transcribing as she passed my office every day. She was deeply moved and said, "I've never seen anyone study English as hard as you do." The last one was my wife, who saw me studying English whenever I had free time, with the tape recorder constantly playing, and said, "Why are you so slow, studying for so long and still not getting it?" Isn't it a good thing that people say I'm smart? Why don't I just go along with it and say, "Yes! For me, learning English is easy. I just listen to tapes and write a bit in my spare time, and before I know it, I've learned it," so that people will think even more highly of my intelligence? Because that's not the reality. One person who read the initial draft of my "Slow English Entry" said to me, "You shouldn't write about the actual difficulties of self-studying English as they are, but should make it sound easier, so that readers will have the confidence to learn." I didn't take his advice, because knowledge is a scientific matter, and there's no room for falsehood. I need to fully express the difficulties of self-study, so that readers are fully mentally prepared.

And so, it becomes clear. It's always like this. Where is there anything easy?

Even today, I haven't achieved the ability to speak English anytime, anywhere, and as I wish. I don't think I can. I am still "only able to say, only will say what I have prepared". However, for this point, I no longer have any confusion. And for me (I believe it is the same for most people), this is already enough.

## 5. Can it be done without a foreign teacher?

In summary, the oral language acquisition method I advocate is nothing more than "write down what you want to say first, then practice and revise continuously". However, I know people are afraid of writing (even in their mother tongue). There are many reasons for not wanting to write, and there are extremely reasonable and powerful bases.

Over the years, what I have taught the most is the essay part of the study abroad exam. The hardest part of teaching study abroad exams may be composition (in fact, even in mother tongue language teaching, the hardest part is composition, right?), because composition is most likely the part that students practice the least (or even don't practice at all). Even if the teaching is good, if the students don't practice, the teacher can't play a role; moreover, what most composition teachers teach is basically "clichés" (universal templates, luxury sentence patterns, advanced vocabulary...). Why don't students write essays? Because it is indeed difficult to write essays. In fact, most people avoid writing essays in school. Why is it so difficult to write an essay? Because writing ability depends more on practice, how can it improve without practice? Then why don't most people practice? Laziness. However, when preparing for an English exam, people often package laziness very gorgeously and exceptionally reasonably. They say "I have finished writing the essay and no one corrects it, how can I make progress!" They think their idea is too reasonable, and even start to fantasize "If there is a foreigner to help me correct the essay, it would be great..."

And here lies the problem.

Hoping for a foreigner to correct your essays is unrealistic for 99.99% of English learners in China. China has such a large population that even if all Americans were invited over, it would clearly not be enough. If we brought all of Canada's population to China, it wouldn't even be enough for Shanghai (Canada's population is only equivalent to that of Shanghai - over twenty million). Besides, would inviting foreigners over solve everything? Not necessarily, right? Not every foreigner is literate, not every literate foreigner has a large vocabulary, and not every foreigner with a large vocabulary is cultured (possessing sufficient knowledge reserves and thinking ability). In fact, within China, the so-called foreign teachers, (I guess) more than half are likely just for show, lacking sufficient knowledge reserves, thinking ability, and academic training. The probability of them scoring full marks on a TOEFL essay or an SAT, GRE essay is actually quite low. The vast majority of these foreign teachers in the United States initially did not have the ability to get into good universities (let alone the possibility of being able to get into graduate school or have the ability to pursue a doctoral degree in the future)... For Chinese students preparing for TOEFL/SAT/GRE, how many of these foreign teachers can be considered qualified?

Going a step further, even if some are indeed qualified, so what? The number is so small (definitely a very small minority), what are the chances that ordinary people like you and me can get their help? And if we really have the chance to meet such a sufficiently qualified foreign teacher, can we really afford the fees (isn't it too much to ask such people to work for free)? Even if we do meet them and can afford the fees, is our level at the time worthy of such expensive and precious help?

But there's an even more serious problem. Is correction really useful?

Do you remember writing essays when you were young? If you think back carefully now, do you really believe that the corrections made by your primary school language teachers had an irreplaceable and incredibly important impact on your writing skills? An uncomfortable truth is that for most people, the corrections made by their primary school language teachers only brought them humiliation. So how did your writing skills improve (if you indeed have writing skills)? I don't mean to belittle all primary school language teachers, I'm just stating facts — the vast majority of people who ultimately possess good writing skills basically rely on themselves: read more, write more, revise more, practice more, observe more, think more, discuss more, accumulate more... And among these things that need to be done more, almost none of them can be led by any teacher, almost all of them are (and can only be) done by oneself. This also explains why some people always wonder "why is there such a big difference between people?" — what's so strange about that? Some people do "more" of everything in their lifetime, some people don't do "more" of anything, or even don't do anything at all.

Looking back now, it's clear that the fundamental reason why many people don't practice English composition is simply because their unrealistic fantasies have not been fulfilled. Giving up opportunities that could have been achieved by oneself just because unrealistic fantasies cannot be fulfilled (in fact, they are bound to be unfulfilled) is nothing but foolishness.

There are two more effective methods:
1. Correct your own essays;

2. Helping others revise their essays.

When revising your own essay, there's an important trick: don't revise immediately after writing, but wait until the next day to make changes. The reason you wrote it that way (even if it's wrong) is because you thought it was correct. This inertia is strongest and most evident right after you finish writing. Therefore, revising immediately after writing may not be as effective. It's different after a day. Many mistakes will almost jump out at you, accompanied by surprise, "Oh my! How could I make such a basic mistake?!" Trust me, this is actually a trace of your real progress—because the most effective ways to create deep memories are repetition and surprise.

Helping others revise their essays is one of the fastest ways to improve your own abilities. You might say, "I can't even do it myself, how can I help others revise?" This is not a problem, just give it a try. Spotting mistakes is much easier than writing an essay, especially other people's mistakes, which are easier for you to find. An interesting phenomenon is that the reviser often gains more than the person being revised. Because, as an individual, you cannot traverse all possible mistakes—just because you don't make some mistakes now doesn't mean you won't make them in the future. When you help others revise their essays, it's like others are helping you test for errors, and you are reaping the benefits—and more often than not, you've already achieved "prevention before it happens."

## 6. Self-Checklist

For the things you've written, you can refer to the following checklist for self-revision. This list is important because it lists the mistakes that almost everyone makes most often:

* Spelling errors: Words are not written according to the correct spelling of the word, but this does not include spelling differences brought about by British English and American English differences.

* Errors in the use of singular and plural forms of nouns: Incorrect use of the number of nouns, including: using the "plural" form of uncountable nouns, using the "plural" form of collective nouns, using singular nouns where plurals should be used (or vice versa), etc.
* Singular countable nouns are not limited: In the sentence, there is no determiner before the singular countable noun, including articles, indefinite pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, noun or pronoun possessives, numerals, and some adjectival possessive pronouns.
* Part of speech errors: In the process of choosing vocabulary, the characteristics of English parts of speech are ignored, and vocabulary is used only according to meaning, resulting in the phenomenon of part of speech usage errors.
* Errors in modification relationships: Violation of the rules of vocabulary modification, adopting inappropriate modification relationships. Including using adjectives to modify verbs, adjectives to modify adjectives, adverbs to modify nouns, etc.
* Collocation errors: In the sentence, there are inappropriate phenomena of vocabulary modification, restriction, and explanation, or the fixed form of vocabulary collocation is used incorrectly.
* Word order errors: The correct and customary expression order is not used to state the content. This includes errors in the order of modifiers, not inverting when inversion is required, etc.
* Errors in the use of non-finite verbs: Incorrect use of present participles, past participles, or infinitives of verbs. This includes:
* Misuse of present participles and past participles: The author does not ensure the consistency of the logical subject and the participle, that is, when the logical subject performs an action, the past participle is used, and when it suffers an action or state, the present participle is used.
* Misuse of infinitives and gerunds: Gerunds express "state, nature, mood, abstraction, regularity, occurrence"; infinitives express "purpose, result, reason, specific, one-time, will occur".

* Misuse of prepositions: The prepositions have been used incorrectly.
* Misuse of conjunctions: The conjunctions have been used incorrectly.
* Misuse of relative pronouns: The relative pronouns have been used incorrectly in the attributive clause.
* Misuse of articles: The difference between definite and indefinite articles has not been understood, or the two indefinite articles have been used incorrectly.
* Misuse of pronouns or unclear reference: The number or gender of the pronouns used by the author does not match the noun, or the reader cannot directly determine the object referred to by the pronouns used by the author.
* Incomplete sentences: Some components, especially the main components of the sentence, are missing.
* Subject-verb disagreement: The subject and verb of the sentence do not satisfy the agreement in "number".
* Violation of the principle of having only one main clause: When a sentence is composed of multiple clauses forming a complex sentence, the author has not ensured that there is only one main clause, i.e., all subordinate clauses must be guided or isolated by conjunctions, relative pronouns, or semicolons, but there must be a unique main clause. Sentences that commit this type of error are called "run-on sentences" or "comma splices".
* Errors in comparative sentences: This includes inconsistencies in the comparative subjects in the comparative sentences, i.e., in a comparative sentence, the two comparative objects introduced by the author do not have the same essence and attributes, i.e., they are "incomparable", or errors in the use of comparative degrees, etc.
* Inconsistency in parallel subjects: In parallel components, the author has not achieved complete equivalence in structure, function, and nature between the parallel parties.
* Tense errors: The tense used by the verb in the sentence is inconsistent with the context of the sentence.

* Voice Mismatch: The voice (active/passive) used in the sentence's verb does not match the subject.
* Mood Error: The sentence does not use the correct indicative or subjunctive mood according to the context.

In fact, in practical operation, the majority of errors made by most Chinese students are two types of errors, singular-plural issues, and tense issues - because Chinese nouns do not distinguish between singular and plural, and Chinese verbs do not have tenses. Once these two errors are eliminated, it is equivalent to solving most of the problems.

In addition to these two issues, what needs to be noted is "consistency": subject-verb agreement, main clause and subordinate clause tense agreement, non-finite verb and logical subject active-passive relationship agreement, pronoun reference agreement, parallel structure agreement... "Consistency" is very important, even for native English speakers, who often make such errors (the SAT grammar test has almost only one point, which is "consistency"). Another important means to avoid errors is to frequently consult reference books, which is the same for everyone - dictionaries and grammar books. The specific usage of reference books will be discussed in detail in later chapters.

## 7. More importantly, the ability to think

Language is ultimately used to express thoughts. Therefore, the way of thinking is extremely important. Most people do not know how to think correctly, so that what they want to express is full of loopholes and they do not know it. This problem causes more trouble, often blamed by some English teachers on "cultural differences between the East and the West", which is a vague statement - in fact, it has little to do with culture, but is a problem of thinking ability. Regarding cultural differences, what is needed first is respect, and what is needed second is understanding. But the difference in thinking ability is another matter. The content expressed is full of holes, no matter what, it can only blame the poor thinking ability, and it has nothing to do with cultural differences.

"One cannot 'only learn English', just as one cannot master computer graphics by only learning 'Photoshop'. Adequate training in color theory and basic hand-drawing is necessary for free creation. Here are a few books that I recommend for anyone wishing to acquire correct thinking skills and, consequently, clear expression:

* Thought and Knowledge: An Introduction to Critical Thinking 4th edition, by Diane F. Halpern
* Thinking and Deciding, 4th edition, by Jonathan Baron
* Argumentation: The Study of Effective Reasoning by Zarefsky David (Audiobook)
* Craft of Research, by Wayne C. Booth, Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams
* Good Reasoning Matters!: A Constructive Approach to Critical Thinking 3rd edition, by Leo A. Groarke, Christopher W. Tindale"

In addition, there are three books on style that you must read:

* A Plain English Handbook (1998), from the Security and Exchange Commission, Prefaced by Warren E. Buffett (http://www.plainlanguage.gov)
* On Writing: A Memoir of The Craft by Stephen King (with audiobook)
* Style: Toward Clarity and Grace by Joseph M. Williams

Also, there is a video course from TTC (The Teaching Company) that is the best writing course I have ever seen:

* Building Great Sentences.

## 8 Secret Weapon — Paraphrasing

Almost all truly effective learning methods are simple, inexpensive, often indirect, but truly effective. Paraphrasing is such an effective method.

Everyone in every culture is the same in this regard — throughout their lives, they are mostly paraphrasing what others have said. First of all, it is difficult for language and text to be purely "original", and in most cases, there is indeed no need to be "unique". What's more important is that the goal of second language learners in most cases is not to engage in professions like poets and novelists, but to hope to master another tool for carrying information and communication — in this case, "paraphrasing" almost occupies all of the application of the second language.

Indeed, this is not as "obvious" as it seems. ETS, after designing and hosting the TOEFL test for decades, only "suddenly realized" and added a large-scale assessment of "paraphrasing ability" in the new TOEFL test: the TOEFL writing section has a comprehensive test, requiring candidates to first read an article, then listen to a lecture related to the article just read, and then paraphrase the content of the lecture and how the content of the lecture is connected with the content of the reading article; the speaking section has first listening then speaking, first reading then speaking, speaking after listening and reading —— all are assessing the candidate's "paraphrasing ability".

## 9. Seemingly redundant: In fact, even "mute English" is not that bad

For quite a long time, my English was what many people despised as "mute English". But even this has not become a barrier or burden for me to use English. I don't think there is anything scary or strange about mute English. We learn any foreign language in the hope of mastering its listening, speaking, reading, and writing. However, for every person who has been struggling for a long time, it is not as easy as initially imagined to progress in listening, speaking, reading, and writing —— this has long been proven by my own (and countless others') experience.

To put it vividly, if you can't speak, you're like a mute; if you can't understand, you're like a deaf person; if you can't read, you're like a blind person; and if you can't write? —— Most cultures do not default that a person who can't write is disabled. Regardless of whether you can write or not, let's just talk about being mute, deaf, and blind. If you have to be one of these three "disabilities", which one would you choose? I've thought about it seriously, I would choose "deaf" —— because if you're not blind or mute, at least you still have the channels of input and output. I'm most afraid of becoming "blind" —— because that is the most important means of input, especially because text input accounts for the vast majority of all effective inputs. In a sense, the greatest commonality of learning a foreign language is to add a different channel of information acquisition. From this point of view, being mute is much stronger than being deaf or blind, and among the latter two, being blind is far worse than being deaf.

Stepping back and trying to stay realistic, we'll find that most people really don't have many opportunities to chat, discuss fervently, or argue intensely with foreigners. More often than not, we just need to be "proficient readers". In a sense, we only need "basic vision" - equivalent to having a basic vocabulary and grammatical knowledge - just as a severely nearsighted person with glasses is thousands of times better than a blind person, anyone just needs a dictionary and a grammar book to have normal vision.

Since we've learned it, the better we use it, the happier we are, which is everyone's normal psychology. But the so-called "good English" is actually hard to have a unified, clear, and meaningful standard. If so, don't care about it, what does it matter if it's good or not? Anyway, it has to be used. As you use it, it gets better, no matter how good it is, it's better than before. Or from another perspective, "it's good enough". Because "good enough" can start to be used, continuous use has the opportunity and possibility of continuous improvement.

My own English pronunciation, although constantly improving, has never been standard, and even has never been "good", at most it is in an "acceptable" state. My vocabulary has never been astonishingly large, despite the fact that my TOEFL and GRE scores are already very "abnormal" (that's because I had to take the test countless times for professional needs to reach that level), but when I read English literature in detail on weekdays, I often need to use various electronic dictionaries and online search tools. When writing English articles, the energy spent on deliberation and review is several times that of writing Chinese articles. Before appearing in a situation where only English can be used, I must spend a lot of time and energy to do homework, and the facts prove that otherwise, there will be all kinds of mistakes.

In truth, my English has never been "good" — even though I've been working in the field of study-abroad exam training for nearly a decade, during which I've taught countless students, many of whom score high or even perfect scores on their study-abroad exams each year. I also provide college application essay guidance for thousands of high school students annually, and in recent years, I've started to visit the United States at least twice a year to interact with the Admissions Officers (equivalent to the directors of the international students' admissions office in domestic universities) of various universities...

But this "not good" state has never been a hindrance or burden to my use of English. It's normal to not be good at a foreign language — this is true for everyone. But not being good doesn't mean "can't use" or "shouldn't use". From another perspective, it's precisely because you're not good that you should use it more and diligently. Use it a bit more, and you'll be better than before — this is actually a characteristic of all tools.
